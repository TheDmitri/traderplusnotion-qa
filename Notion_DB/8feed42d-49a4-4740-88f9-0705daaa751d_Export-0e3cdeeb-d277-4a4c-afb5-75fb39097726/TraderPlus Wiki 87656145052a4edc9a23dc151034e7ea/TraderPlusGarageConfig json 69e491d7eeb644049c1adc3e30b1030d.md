# TraderPlusGarageConfig.json

Owner: Dmitri Medeleiv

# Summary:

---

The garage system is pretty like what you may have seen already in the modding community. It allows users to store vehicles into an external database to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the vehicle from the server environment such as raiding, server database wipe, DayZ bugs and mainly to improve server performances. And then, when the user wants it, to get back the car in a parking location near the garage npc. This garage system **is for now compatible with TraderPlus CarLock, Trader keys and MuchCarKey.**

Now that we know how the garage system works, let‚Äôs talk about how to set it up.In your TraderPlusConfig folder, you should find a new config folder called:-**TraderPlusGarageConfig.json**

## Summary:

---

Receipts are piece of paper containing all your vehicle‚Äôs information. 

This includes:

- The vehicle‚Äôs health
- The vehicle‚Äôs attachment
- The vehicle‚Äôs cargo

The receipt can be used to:

- Provide as proof of ownership to a trader when selling the vehicle.
- Storing your vehicle to protect it from damage or being stolen.

### How can I pack a vehicle into a receipt ?

In order to pack a vehicle you must have a TraderPlusWrench in your hand and satisfy the following condition:

---

- The vehicle must have a CarLock attached ( if CarLock is not disabled)
    
    OR the vehicle must have a key assigned and be unlock (MCK, Trader, ExpansionKey)
    
- You should be in the safe zone (if IsReceiptTraderOnly is set to 1)
- The cargo of the vehicle must be empty (if SaveVehicleCargo is set to 0)

## How can I deploy a car once it‚Äôs a receipt ?

---

**Keep in mind you can only deploy a receipt in a safe zone if IsReceiptTraderOnly is set to 1.**

The vehicle can be either deployed by placing the hologram on the position and orientation of your choosing

**OR**

You can throw the receipt (*yes, you‚Äôre right, fucking Dmitri is telling you to throw it like a PokeBall*) and it will deploy the car when it reach the ground. Make sure the area where you are placing it is clear.

(There are script securities to make sure that we can‚Äôt deploy a car on a player or on a roof)
