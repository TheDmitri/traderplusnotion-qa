359111670385082369,blackoutsdayz,11/08/2020 6:37 AM,"I keep getting this error when I try to call my custom vehicle class from any other class. 

***Trying to call non-static function 'FlipSwitch' as static***

Basically I'm trying to toggle a state in my vehicle class using OnKeyPress or an Actiondata. 

`void FlipSwitch()
{
    if ( GetAnimationPhase(""BlackoutSwitch"") == 1.0 )
    {
        SetAnimationPhase (""BlackoutSwitch"", 0);
    }
    else
    {
        SetAnimationPhase (""BlackoutSwitch"", 1);
    }                    
}`


I have tried this (not the full code but everything works until it gets here):

`override void OnExecuteServer( ActionData action_data )
    {
        HumanCommandVehicle vehCommand = action_data.m_Player.GetCommand_Vehicle();
        if ( vehCommand )
        {
            Transport trans = vehCommand.GetTransport();
            if ( trans )
            {
                if(trans.GetType() == ""vg7_corvette"")
                {
                    CarScript car;
                    if ( Class.CastTo(car, trans) && car.EngineIsOn() )
                    {
                        //car.ToggleHeadlights();
                        vg7_corvette.FlipSwitch();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }`

And this:

`modded class MissionGameplay extends MissionBase
{
    override void OnKeyPress(int key)
    {
        super.OnKeyPress(key);
        switch (key)

I've not messed with them but plain on making them a thing next time I wipe. 
Does FlagRefreshFrequency mean it takes 5 days to goto the bottom and if not raised the items will despawn depending on lifetime?
Does FlagRefreshMaxDuration means it takes 40 days for your flag to despawn?

Can anyone tell me a possible reason as to why a loading screen script for Expansion would display a white background/screen instead of said background picture? I got it working once until I went to switch pictures, then after that white screen. Tried reverting, same result. White screen where background should be. I even tried to use Bohemia's weird picture resolution scaling (ex: 2048x1024), even though this shouldn't be an issue.

I tried using Gimp to export to tga, then manually rename, same result. I tried using Workbench to convert tga file to edds, same result. I tried using TexView2 to convert, same result. I tried both PBO Manager and Addon Builder (with and without binarizing/extended logging) with the same result. Another thing to note, any PBO I make with Addon Builder does not load on startup, whereas PBO Manager does seem to pack properly and load.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am at a complete loss",,

Set the seed with `proto native static int Randomize(int seed);`
