240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:07 AM,Is it possible to split some code from init.c to another file,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:07 AM,and call it using a includeOnce type of function?,,

``` #include ""$CurrentDir:\\mpmissions\\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\\admintool.c"" ```",,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:11 AM,Appending the file would just be #include?,,
284737459601014794,corewarp,12/20/2018 2:12 AM,I don't understand the question,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:12 AM,so Im going to try and throw my squads loadouts onto a seperate file not part of init.c,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:12 AM,and then call that file during the playerCreation,,
284737459601014794,corewarp,12/20/2018 2:12 AM,You don't call the file,,
284737459601014794,corewarp,12/20/2018 2:13 AM,You put what I posted into the top of init.c,,
284737459601014794,corewarp,12/20/2018 2:13 AM,and then call the method that you define in that file,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:13 AM,Hmm,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/20/2018 2:14 AM,okay looks like I'll have to play with it then because they method will get called more than once,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,12/23/2018 3:52 PM,One. You can completely remove the disease modifiers from registering. Two you can get the disease and call Deactivate();,,

Got quite a bunch of experience doing arma scripting, took a quick look at that template (very very slowly easing into dayz modding), but noticed a couple thing. First off, in regards to folder names. I'm guessing the classnames in `mod.cpp` are hardcoded and if those are used it's magical autoloaded stuff? Also, does the `player` / `items` folder name at all matter or is that just some arbitrary thing (Excepting the game to just magically load in any `*.c` file? Also is the `SA_FlashLight.c` plus the class name inside that supposed to be always named after a cfgVehicles class? And if so, it'll automatically connect code to said cfgVehicles class?
