561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:20 PM,actually i solved it already with the ScriptInvoker: https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/492295576470290433/1025078164076118026,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:20 PM,I just wanted to understand why my aproach wasnt working.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 8:21 PM,Because it is not using reflection,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 8:22 PM,And the managed stuff,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:22 PM,*reflection* ... i know that from PHP. Used it a lot by myself. Didn't think of that in enforce. maybe i still have a fundamental misconception about how enforce works.,,

Have a timer for each seperate item (they all have the same baseclass) i spawn or set a unix timestamp and have a check if the timestamp has reached the timestamp + milliseconds needed after iterating through an array where i store all the spawned ones to do something with these items?",,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 9:36 PM,"i would group them per timer in a map. so all items that have a timer of lets say 5minutes will be processed at a time. i did this recently with `GetGame().GetCallQueue( CALL_CATEGORY_SYSTEM ).CallLater( ... );`

708201682084823071,djhelix,09/29/2022 10:18 PM,"I wasn't speaking of the game itself. I was speaking of the Enforce scripting language. According to the community wiki,
'It is a Object-Oriented Scripting Language (OOP) that works with objects and classes and is similar to C# programming language.'

That is what I was speaking of. As well, slow is relative anyways.  It depends on lots of factors. Heap usage in a tight loop? Ye, could slow things down sure. General usage on a PC? Probably premature optimization. Depends on what the struct contains. You can't just say ""avoid whenever possible"" for that...far too general.",,

185697101735264257,flipperplz,09/29/2022 11:30 PM,99% sure it uses c++ rand,,
266878455809835008,misterj3012,09/29/2022 11:31 PM,oh damn... you may have a snippet for a calc from 1 to 100 or 0.0 to 1 to 100 you can recommend to use?,,
266878455809835008,misterj3012,09/29/2022 11:32 PM,I mean... i can use 50324324 else of the recommendations but you seem to be very experienced (and have tested the most) 😅,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,09/29/2022 11:33 PM,Should be able to use `Math.RandomInt() % 100`,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,09/29/2022 11:34 PM,No use in creating your own rng unless the default isn't good enough for you,,
266878455809835008,misterj3012,09/29/2022 11:34 PM,It feels... too generic 😅,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,09/29/2022 11:34 PM,"Or even use the range feature, im pretty sure RandomInt can take an argument for the range aswell",,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,09/29/2022 11:36 PM,In that case you would want to create your own. Ive only ever had to use a LCG in enforce once and it was more for string obfuscation/scrambling Its not really needed,,
266878455809835008,misterj3012,09/29/2022 11:37 PM,"So basically... if not really needed... In general it should meet my ""normal (DayZ)"" demands what it offers?",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2022 2:18 AM,You can’t fire a weapon via script and it do damage appropriately,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2022 2:18 AM,Unless an actually player is holding it,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2022 2:19 AM,Jacob or Ralian would know more tbh,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2022 2:19 AM,They dealt with that kind of shenanigans for eAI,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,09/30/2022 2:21 AM,im not worried about damage.. just firing.. using a bullet.. that kinda thing.. synced between client and serer.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/30/2022 2:27 AM,The scripting language is done in c++ so what I said still applies,,

272245679013888011,marioe,09/30/2022 2:29 AM,Any sane and decent programmer would do so and it's something than in every proper class about a programming language that allows you to do stuff on the stack as well would recommend as a best practice,,

272245679013888011,marioe,09/30/2022 2:50 AM,The actual firing is handled engine side,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/30/2022 2:50 AM,The way eAI does it is with faking it with raycasts,,

If I want to close a widget (new custom class - custom submenu in the main menu, simillar to `class ModsMenuDetailed` closing with a cross) but at the same time I want to make the root of another widget visible directly in the main menu - where should I place the condition/method to make this widget visible?

When switching or closing with buttons (and various combinations between them) in the main menu, I got this window to work, but unfortunately I can't think of (after several unsuccessful attempts) how I could achieve this.
Every hint whould be really appreciated ❤️",,

And how does the script know about the different Enemies now? String called Type defined in Enemy. Then there is an array referred to the class Enemy which we call Enemies. So this whole thing is defined in class EnemyConfig which is loaded in SomeMethod().

As far as I know, Missiongameplay is not managed, so using a timer there is a bit tricky.
Would you consider more acceptable to:

1) do a lazy call with a Calllater, knowing that
    a) it will not be a repeatable one
    b) it will be attached to a keypress, run maybe once per minute
    c) it will be of category GUI, so run on the client (I'm aware of the 4 hours server issue with repeating Calllaters)
or
2) count the ticks of OnUpdate() and use that as a marker, knowing that
    a) the delay will then be dependent on the frametime of the client (afaik), so not 100% accurate

I thought i could use `ReplaceEdibleWithNew( ""my_empty_can_item"" );`
But somehow it crashes the client.

Error Log:
```ReplaceEdibleWithNew - cannot use edible without player
Class:      'BakedBeansCan_Opened'
Entity id:2952609

Function: 'Error'
Stack trace:
scripts/1_Core/proto\endebug.c:92

Line 92 in endebug:
```//! Messagebox with error message
void Error(string err)
{
    Error2("""", err);

I try to call the fuction on EEDelete():

```modded class Edible_Base extends ItemBase
{
    override void EEDelete( EntityAI parent )
    {
        if ( this.GetType().Contains(""_Opened"" ) )
        {
            if ( !this.IsKindOf(""FoodCan_100g_Opened_ColorBase"") && !this.IsKindOf(""FoodCan_250g_Opened_ColorBase"") )

            }
        }
        super.EEDelete( parent );
    }
};```



And this would be the ReplaceEdibleWithNew Function:
```void ReplaceEdibleWithNew( string typeName )
    {
        PlayerBase player = PlayerBase.Cast(GetHierarchyRootPlayer());
        if (player)

            player.ServerReplaceItemInHandsWithNew(lambda);
        }
        else

Since whenever i try to setup Workbench i retire from it since no tutorial out there seems to work. 
The last one i followed was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyy194Ihcj0 
But after following all these steps when starting Workbench i end up with an error message pointing to CF *""cannot compile game script module ... undefined function ... whatsoever""*
*Work*bench refuses to *work*.
The guy does it in video and it magically works. I repeat this 1:1 and it crashes.
*WTF?!?* 
Is this tutorial also *that* outdated *again?*
So ... is there *any* at least *half way* up to date *working* resource out there explaining how to *setup and actually use* Workbench *for modding*? (i prefer non video tutorials that not only show *what* to put *where* but actually *explain why* - but i'm good as long as it *actually works*)",,

I could need some advice, or if someone has done it already, some examples too 😄 
I am working on a PKP atm. Have finished the Models, the configs and so on.
But i would like to have a extra mechanic around the ammo for it.
Since it is feed from a ammo belt out of a Box magazine, i don't want it to take normal 7.62x54 ammo.
I made a separate ammo variant that has chain links from that ammo belt on them.
i want that players need to craft this ammo out of the normal 7.62x54 cartridge and the links of the ammo belt that ppl are also supposed to be able to find.
now, i also want, this crafting to be a continuous action, like loading a magazine. one short circle subtracts one bullet and one chain link from the inventory, and adds one of the 7.62x54 belt cartridge to the inventory.
now, normal crafting recipes are never continuous and only converts the stack. if i use that, i run into the problem, that a combination basically always generates a full stack unless i put a set limit and it also always consumes the full stack no matter how much/little is in the stack of the ingredients unless i set an arbitrary requirement... so normal crafting sucks ass for this.
I would also like to have an action to split the belt cartridge again into the chain link and ammo... also continuous.

I am still a noob at scripting. any advice and help would be greatly appreciated.",,
