I tried this a few weeks go but couldn’t get server side to do anything so visually the object was there but player could walk thru it then get bounced back as the server didn’t understand how the player did it because it was still on server wide. Would you mind sharing your method so I can test as well?,,

292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:25 PM,"@hlynge 
just started to learn it a few days ago and so far I have found these differences:
unlike C#, there is no garbage collection
unlike C++, there is no multiple inheritence
unlike both of them, there is no way to pass an object of custom class by value, all objects of custom class are passed by reference
also there is a `modded` keyword which is awesome",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,"also what is cool, there is automatic refcounting and autonulling of object pointers, provided by ref keyword",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,There's garbage collection,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,Huh? how?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:29 PM,You don't have access to it directly but everything gets cleaned up when it's no longer in scope,,

What do you mean by this",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:31 PM,"Hmm I might be wrong with my statement then. There is refcounting for sure, but as I understand it's not like the C# garbage collector (about which I have very little understanding)",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:31 PM,It's still a form of garbage collection,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:34 PM,"> What do you mean by this
well a 'pass by value' is the opposite of passing by reference
and it's stated on the wiki page that
`Objects in enforce script are references and are passed by reference`",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:36 PM,Ah yeah nevermind I think I was reading it wrong,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:37 PM,"Yeah it's strange sometimes because i usually tend to try to modify the passed parameter, but forget it's just a reference, effecting the original object instead of it being a copy.",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:38 PM,Also happens with string splitting,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:38 PM,hmm maybe there is a keyword to tell compiler that you are not going to modify the passed object 🤔,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:39 PM,"Sadly no, if you want a copy you're going to have to manually do it in your method",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:40 PM,"Also what I haven't figured out yet...
Can we implement =,-,[] operators of a custom class?
Is there an automated way to make a deep copy of an object?",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:41 PM,"I don't think so, I know you can just create another instance of the object and then reference the original object",,

I tried this a few weeks go but couldn’t get server side to do anything so visually the object was there but player could walk thru it then get bounced back as the server didn’t understand how the player did it because it was still on server wide. Would you mind sharing your method so I can test as well?

    This looks like C but I think it's actually this language:

    https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax
    
    THINGS TO NOTE:
    
    1. Variables are method scoped, not block scoped.  So this won't compile:
    
        if (blah)
        {
            string color = ""Blue"";
            DoSomething(color);
        }
        else
        {
            string color = ""Green""; // duplicate definition of color, because it is method scoped.
            DoSomething(color);
        }
    
    2. Random shit like pushToChamberFromAttachedMagazine is in scope. 
       So if you get a ""indentifier has already been defined"" kind of error, 
       and you're asking yourself ""Am I insane ?"" then, unless you are, then you're not.
       Be aware, not alert.

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/12/2020 1:05 PM,"The http overhead is sooo little you can not even measure it reliably. You would need a synthetic benchmark to notice a difference. If people don't want to use SQL, should the team add yet another connector and expose all calls to it etc etc? It makes absolutely no sense at all to offer anything other than a generic interface. And a curl client is superior to a native library call because it has a built in web client that otherwise needs to be reproduced with a custom extension that also needs to be shipped with the mod and approved by battleye on each update",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/12/2020 1:06 PM,There was a lot of thought put into this and we have been discussing extensions vs curl client vs pipes vs other alternatives for quite a bit,,
