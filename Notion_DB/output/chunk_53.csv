292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:25 PM,"@hlynge 
just started to learn it a few days ago and so far I have found these differences:
unlike C#, there is no garbage collection
unlike C++, there is no multiple inheritence
unlike both of them, there is no way to pass an object of custom class by value, all objects of custom class are passed by reference
also there is a `modded` keyword which is awesome",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,"also what is cool, there is automatic refcounting and autonulling of object pointers, provided by ref keyword",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,There's garbage collection,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:28 PM,Huh? how?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:29 PM,You don't have access to it directly but everything gets cleaned up when it's no longer in scope,,

What do you mean by this",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:31 PM,"Hmm I might be wrong with my statement then. There is refcounting for sure, but as I understand it's not like the C# garbage collector (about which I have very little understanding)",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/05/2020 7:31 PM,It's still a form of garbage collection,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:34 PM,"> What do you mean by this
well a 'pass by value' is the opposite of passing by reference
and it's stated on the wiki page that
`Objects in enforce script are references and are passed by reference`",,

292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/05/2020 7:38 PM,hmm maybe there is a keyword to tell compiler that you are not going to modify the passed object ü§î,,

    This looks like C but I think it's actually this language:

    https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax
    
    THINGS TO NOTE:
    
    1. Variables are method scoped, not block scoped.  So this won't compile:
    
        if (blah)
        {
            string color = ""Blue"";
            DoSomething(color);
        }
        else
        {
            string color = ""Green""; // duplicate definition of color, because it is method scoped.
            DoSomething(color);
        }
    
    2. Random shit like pushToChamberFromAttachedMagazine is in scope. 
       So if you get a ""indentifier has already been defined"" kind of error, 
       and you're asking yourself ""Am I insane ?"" then, unless you are, then you're not.
       Be aware, not alert.
