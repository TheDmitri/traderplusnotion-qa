General question for you I guess. Currently I am trying to write out the UID, position and time a user has died. I have got this working to the point where I write the data to a JSON file called UID.JSON and in that file write the location and time of death. 

Now I want to store this data until it is 60 minutes old, however I want it to store multiple user deaths and the time of each one. My quesion is how would you guys store this data? I was thinking having a JSON array and storing each death as part of that array, however I'm struggling with that one.

I'm new to DayZ scripting and have dabbled in C# before, so I'm not completely fresh and I'm fumbling through, I was just curious as to how you would achieve this.",,

if statements require a true/false value to evaluate.
Your if statement ` if ( FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponHandguardAK"") == NULL )` reads in plain english ""If the attachment at slot `weaponHandguardAK` is not null""

In order to know if the attachment at slot `weaponHandguardAK` exists, we ""grab"" that attachment with `FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponHandguardAK"")`.
`FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponHandguardAK"")` returns an object that either IS THE OBJECT you want or NULL (doesn't exist)

Knowing this, instead of just checking if the object is null, in my example, we first store the attachment in a variable THEN check if it is null like your code, then checks the item type as you requested.",,

I want to add visible Binoculars attachment to all the vanilla backpacks
I've added and configured slot for this thing, it is working fine, but
it has no proxy to be displayed on actual model (it is expected)

Am I right, that your voodoo magic is based on AddChild functionality
and should attach object to parent when slot attachment is updated?
Like I need to spawn this Binocular in the world and then move it with backpack

So the thing I wanted to try:
1. Add a proxy on backpack when it is spawned (i.e. in constructor)
2. Place this proxy relatively on actual model
2. Use this new proxy with custom slot",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/26/2022 5:09 PM,"Part of the trouble you will have with attaching to a backpack is the child actually needs to attach to a bone index to move properly. Attaching to backpack in hand and on ground would look normal but when backpack is attached to player, the child of the backpack with move with the player pos and not with the backpack that‚Äôs weight painted. Does that make sense?",,
330475826158108674,mikkbenelis,03/26/2022 5:19 PM,"Yes, it makes sense
I think, I've even seen this problem with some mod from workshop

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/26/2022 5:29 PM,One way to fix is to create an object in OB that is just a proxy to the Binocs then define that as spine or whatever in sections and model cfg. Then make a class object out of it. With a custom slot on it. Then attach that object to backpack at constructor. Then script when binoc attached to backpack. It loops thru and finds the hidden object and creates binocs in its inventory attachment slot.,,

I was using RCP manager, it was all easy and straightforward, until I tried passing data from PlayerBase to MissionServer.

The idea is that.
MissionServer handles delayed penalties to the logged out players. Non-existent disconnected. Just punishes their abandoned characters. That punishment function is working fine. But now I want to catch the moment somebody is Killed and call that function from PlayerBase: EEKilled. 

No errors, nothin. RPC sent, RCP is just silent in MissionBase.

I miss something logical and basic. Can anyone explain?",,

I am calling

SetEventMask(EntityEvent.CONTACT | EntityEvent.SIMULATE);

I create it with:
```
JMC_myObj myObj = JMC_myObj.Cast(GetGame().CreateObject(""JMC_myObj"", vStartPosition, false, true, true));

But 
```
override void EOnSimulate(IEntity owner, float dt)

181864632216977408,arkensor,03/28/2022 12:28 PM,"Hmmm I do use `EOnSimulate` but only on the client. And I use BuildingBase, and the object does have a physics body etc. I can not remember all conditions for it to become active and be simulated, but by default plain buildings are not part of the simulation cycle. You could go for `OnUpdate`. That is called right before the physics are calculated, so any collision change would be respected.",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,03/28/2022 12:31 PM,"MoveInTime works with buildings, no problem. Do note that for the host the interpolation does not happen. For your dedicated server it instantly teleports, there is no sweeping collision or anything. So do not move it too far per frame. Simulate the movement without it, e.g. lerp vector A -> B with fixed speed * deltaTime and then on top you can replace the setposition/settransform with MoveInTime(nextPos, deltaTime) to make it looks smoother on the client. For server it will remain a choppy e.g. 10 or 20 fps movement, but like that you get proper physics, and for the client its interpolated and looks butter smooth.",,

Either that or one of the other GetPosition lookalikes on `EntityAI` or `Object` returns the global world space position no matter the hierarchy - i had to do debug printing about this once and I think I found one way there.
