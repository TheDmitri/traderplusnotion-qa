181864632216977408,arkensor,12/30/2020 3:25 PM,Mod the action condition to return false for your usecase,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,12/30/2020 3:26 PM,I need this action 🙂,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,12/30/2020 3:26 PM,then you will need to display it as well,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,12/30/2020 3:26 PM,there must be way 🙂,,

Oof, thanks a lot for that. I was trying to use it in the definition instead of before the call.
I am going to play with this a bit. If you can give any tips on async event handling or concurrent queues that would be nice. I am assuming these `thread`s are actual threads and not some kind of green tasks or whatever you want to call them?
I ask because I recall seeing some setting somewhere for setting the number of threads used for jobs. So, it is not really clear how all of it is implemented.

Sorry for my terminology, I am mixing other languages because I know next to nothing about Enforce.",,

has high overhead -- In which case I'd want to spin up a single thread and push tasks into some queue.

356744388447043584,s4mt3k,01/06/2021 11:24 AM,"Hey guys 👋🏻 

I got a little ""instance"" problem i guess.

I am boosting a Players Stamina for a limited time of 60 seconds, via an Action.

So OnFinishProgressServer() i Use:

`GetGame().GetCallQueue(CALL_CATEGORY_GAMEPLAY).CallLater(BoostStaminaLimited, 2000, true, StaminaPlayer);`
AND
`GetGame().GetCallQueue(CALL_CATEGORY_GAMEPLAY).CallLater(RemoveBoost, m_StaminaBoostTime, false);`

this is working Perfectly.

BUT when a player disconnects, it is performing the boost again and again until its time is over.
I tried to fix that in a modded Missionserver and do a remove on `InvokeOnDisconnect`
but what i found out is, that the instance from my `ref` is an absolute different one.

So it isnt removing, not either when i try to perform that in playerbase itself.

SomeOne Any Ideas?!",,

Is it possible to disable Shooting-Vehicle Damage?
