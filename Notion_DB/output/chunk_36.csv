424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/10/2019 1:36 AM,If it's whole number then it's probably just using the frequency as an index,,
424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/10/2019 1:43 AM,`#tune_frequency` becomes `Change Frequency` from the stringtable and then it puts the index in so there must be somewhere limiting the range,,

Someone remembers at that time the famous Bambiland or Good vs Evil, where there were tents with loot inside ...
Anyone know how to respawnear the tents and that after a restart they return to their original state? (The tent in the same position and the original loot)
That only the characters have persistence.
I leave it in this section of Discord because I honestly don't know where to put it.",,

Storage_xxxx you can make a clean copy of it when the tents are all untouched. When you wish to reload that same one, you simply replace all content of the current storage folder to the old EXCEPT for the file that saves player data ‘players.db’",,

Alternatively you can write a script in Enforce to spawn your players with random gear, or select preset loadouts. Obviously selection at that point is tricky, however having randomly to pick one via script is not so bad.",,

356744388447043584,s4mt3k,08/14/2019 11:57 PM,"Question to the Pro´s. 

is it Possible to Put the `Print("""");` function into another function? 

like this:

I just want it empty and callable via a function: like: `MyPrint(""thisis a print"");`

But Only when a state is true: 

i dont want to write it always 

```if(DebugPrintBool)
{ 
Print(""My Debug print"");
}```

i just want it short, and in one line...",,
356744388447043584,s4mt3k,08/15/2019 12:06 AM,"@Species I think this belongs into #configs-dayz 
But for now:

If serverTimeAcceleration = 24; A day will pass in 1 hour.

The night is Multiplied by itself AND the value above... so if you set it to 2 and  serverTimeAcceleration  is still 24 you will have 1 hour day, 30 minutes night... (value is 48...48 times faster)

if you want 30 minutes night, regardless of what the day is, the nightMultiplier has to be 48 after multiplied with the daytime. (correct me if im wrong)

so:

 `serverTimeAcceleration=6`
`serverNightTimeAcceleration=8;`",,

its not possible to make it so each of them take one slot, the clipping would be terrible, sadly, they all need to be mask, and the terrorist wrap maybe even mask and headgear at the same time, or i will script it so you can only wear helmets along with it later, no other headgear.

Add to your server launchparameter: 

-adminlog

Or if you just want to print some debuglogs into your scripts.log file, write the following into your code:

`Print(""::: DEBUGPRINT::: This is a DebugPrint"");`

I hope i could help ❤

EDIT: of course you can change the Text between the `"" ""` to whatever you need.
This can repeated as many times as you need the print 😄",,

428365376959807499,jbae#3434,08/22/2019 5:42 PM,"204 is still successful, just no content",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:42 PM,"idk, these are things that need testing",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:42 PM,"No, I know",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,But how does cURL see it,,
428365376959807499,jbae#3434,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,"201 for CREATED, like on a `POST`",,

230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,"On first release, it was timing out on 200",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,And 200 means it's all ok,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,soo,,
428365376959807499,jbae#3434,08/22/2019 5:43 PM,Just let people handle the status codes. Anything 200 range hitting a successful closure,,
