Eliteness (and dep3d) only list their names not their location. Needing to 'know' their location is wooly thinking. The designer of the p3d sets a mempoint called 'light' in the exact spot he wants it to appear, and similarly 'doplvani' (the supply point) is the exact place the designer wants things to attach. 

even if the values were spat out, the numbers have no meaning. there is no sensible visual translation of where that point actually is that would give the user any better idea than just attaching in the first place (and looking for himself at the result)",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/27/2019 6:06 PM,it might have something to do with whatever they had to fix to stop the houses tilting when doors were opened?,,
