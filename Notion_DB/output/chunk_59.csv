368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2020 12:37 AM,actually there's more than 2,,

@Cleetus Understood",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2020 12:39 AM,and item.Type() returns a string,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2020 12:39 AM,so you want to compare a string to a string as a condition,,

181254147679584257,thesixx,07/03/2020 12:40 AM,"Great explanation, thank you",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2020 12:40 AM,"where it matters more, is if you want to use it in more than 1 location in your code",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2020 12:42 AM,"and just so you know, `super.SetCallBackDuration(item)` would quite literally return the result that the vanilla SetCallBackDuration function would give",,

Maybe something that goes in init.c , for example -look for player name -> if player name = toastie -> spawn that player with an apple. Thanks in advance, sorry if this is a stupid question 😅

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:19 PM,so the defaults in the class will all get overwritten by the JSON loader,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:19 PM,Is t here a reason the client needs to know about all these variables ?,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,yes,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,you need to send configs to all players who will join the server,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,Are you sure ?,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,yes,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,Im not sure the type of config stuff you saving,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,I dont want to spoil it but we are working on palyer effects based on smoking,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,sickness,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,Ah,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,addiction,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,cameras 😉,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,Idk about camera,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,those are ALL client side and effect the player,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:20 PM,But addication ect should be server authoritive ?,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 2:21 PM,Very similar to how RoomService code is written ),,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:21 PM,"yes, I worked with RoomService a lot on a custom raiding mod",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:22 PM,@Kuli_VT So you basiclly trying to create new player modifiers right ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:22 PM,Those are created on the server,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:22 PM,Although I also looked at BreachingCharge and others and they all do the same thing with JSON configs,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:22 PM,All those run on the server,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,"Effects have to be played on the client, and those have to be send with a rpc",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,the only reason you need server side is if other clients need to see it,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,Then those rpc could contain duration,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,"no they dont, player camera is local to player only",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,you dont see my NVG effect,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,Okay yeah camera could be,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,same with shaking,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,Yeah effects are played local for sure,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:23 PM,imagine you are addicted to cigs and you need to smoke them or you shake a little more 😉,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,I agree though,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,the AMT of the addiction needs to be saved,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,so you have it when you load back in,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,Thing is you wan't some of them still server authoritive ?,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,but I am not even that far yet 🙂,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,Unless they have no sereus effects,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:24 PM,"so, in this particular case, an effect is triggered by an amount of intake",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,that is ALL client side,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,I wanted those amts to be variabel,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,hence where I am stuck,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,Okay,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,"I will write to you again, you need to send this config to all players who join, otherwise they will not learn information from the server",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,And those variables cause you to get sick ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,shake ect,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,It sounds like something you want to run on the server,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:25 PM,eventually yes,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,"remember, this is all very very infancy",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,You generaly speaking don't want to give players control,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,right now I just want to be able to change whther the effects are on or off,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,"no, I want to give server owners a way to disable it",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,in case they dont like it,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:26 PM,if its calculated on the players machine he is able to hack it without server authority,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,I get what you saying,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,IF you wa n't to do that,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,You have to do what kactet said,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,Кастет Thank you (I cant find your username to tag you) I will keep looking,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,YOu will have to replicate those variables yourself,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:27 PM,There are context objects you can s ave varibles to,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:28 PM,"ok, I again want to keep this simple for now",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:28 PM,just enable the effect or no,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:29 PM,Doing things between server and client is not easy,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:29 PM,tell me about it,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:29 PM,unless you can use RegisterNetSyncVariable,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:33 PM,you still have syncvar,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:34 PM,Rpc's are more meant for executing functionality on a remote object /(client /server / real world stuff),,

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:37 PM,is there a timing constraint?  ie as soon as I connect this data should be available?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:37 PM,OnPlayerConnect or something like that,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:46 PM,In this big functions there is 1 part im very intrested in,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:46 PM,I want to call a other functions After SendEntityKilled,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:46 PM,I can't ovveride that function as its static,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:46 PM,"So this is what i had to do 
```cs
    override void OnCommandHandlerTick(float delta_time, int pCurrentCommandID)
    {
        //Copied death condition from base class ! instead of calling that other funtion we call our sync event

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:47 PM,Now i create some pain formyself cuz what if they change when this is triggerd ? ect,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:47 PM,"yeah, I get that",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:47 PM,so if they would have split this check into a seperate function that returns true or false i would have been chilling,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,"I got bit by many changes in 1.08, they changed the whole weapon sway, hold breathe mechanic",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,but i assume those are things that started throwing errors ?,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,"not sure if you've played, I really really really dont like the new mechanic, but it is much more realistic",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,you start wheezing LOL,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,In this case i would be more scared of them adding a extra check in the if statement that i wouldn't check for,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:48 PM,Honnestly,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:49 PM,I played dayz for 20 hours,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:49 PM,Way to hardcore for me,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:49 PM,"yeah, in many cases I had to re-add entire chunks and update",,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:50 PM,"also like 400 in arma2, only played dayz there",,

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:51 PM,Discord figured it out for me kinda,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:51 PM,Ah luckey you,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:52 PM,They should allow @ #usernumber,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:52 PM,I need to get workbench fixed so I can try this RPC stuff,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:53 PM,it seems way more powerful than NetSync,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:53 PM,It for sure is,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:53 PM,I like that its ID specific,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:53 PM,I think if you put id at -1 its replicated to all if its the server,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:53 PM,"again, using CodeLock and others as guides I can see how its useful for things like saving keycodes, pins etc",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:54 PM,never seen there code 😉,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:54 PM,"But its great for events that have to be triggerd from client to server and other way around.
not just replicating data",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:54 PM,"For instance you have a shop ui , then tell the server you try to buy that item with a rpc",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:55 PM,yes,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:55 PM,I looked extensively into the trader mod too (did a lot of stuff with safezones),,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:55 PM,my stuff is such small potatoes,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:56 PM,compared to this giant mods,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:56 PM,SHouldn't worry about that stuff. Some people work on  it since day 1,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:56 PM,Or have been doing 3d stuff since arma 3,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:56 PM,"even my work with CodeLock was around allowing different configs based on weapons, and different levels of strength, vs just one config for everything",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:57 PM,so if you had a really expensive lock it would take WAY longer to hack through,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:57 PM,stuff like that,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:57 PM,thats why his config is the most familiar to me,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:58 PM,now to solve workbench problems....again,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 2:59 PM,🤣,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 2:59 PM,"yeah, and as a low level firmware guy, debugging is kind of key, I see why everything takes so long to fix LOL",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:00 PM,we even have to look at memory maps and not allow compilers to define anything,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:00 PM,we can spend $100k just on a debugger,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:01 PM,have to write REALLY REALLY REALLY good code so people can write $hit code to run on it 😉,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:02 PM,"my analogy is Google Chrome, back when DRAM prices were sky high they actually tried to be good about mem management, now that DRAM is cheap, Chrome uses like 4GB of memory just to look at the google homepage",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:05 PM,Yeah i spent 5 weeks reducing cpu usage of a system i wrote,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:05 PM,And a other 2 weeks to fix some momory leaks,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:06 PM,"so, now that I am looking at the RPC",,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:06 PM,"does that code handle the request and the receive or do I also need to add the ""send""",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:08 PM,How do you mean ?,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:08 PM,is there client side AND server side RPCs that need to sync,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:09 PM,"or is it just one request, and the client responds, I would assume I need both",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:10 PM,You send the Request,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:10 PM,And then you deal with the response in OnRpc,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:11 PM,Rpc's do not have return values,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:11 PM,(if you want to return something from a rpc you will have to do that with an other rpc,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,07/04/2020 3:11 PM,so it looks like I should just write an RPC handler now,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/04/2020 3:11 PM,You can see here kinda what you are dealing with,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 4:48 PM,i want to send an rpc to the player from the UI so i suppose i need to know the identity,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 4:49 PM,The Ui only works on the client,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 4:49 PM,GetGame().GetPlayer() in the class constructor of your menu,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 4:50 PM,thanks,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 4:51 PM,is client player inventory always synced with server? or do i have to do rpcs on server from client to check something in inventory?,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 4:52 PM,It depends on what you want to do,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 4:52 PM,one function to check for availability of item and one function to remove said item from inventory,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 4:53 PM,I think you should throw items out of inventory on the server side,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/04/2020 4:54 PM,in this case there shouldn't be a problem with out of sync,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 5:04 PM,can i check on client after if the item is still there?,,

558719861463842852,glutenfreevapes,07/04/2020 6:25 PM,What's the context?,,
558719861463842852,glutenfreevapes,07/04/2020 6:29 PM,Check on client > transaction pending > RPC to server > do stuff on server > RPC to client > transaction complete > check if item is there?,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 6:56 PM,it's for the crafting menu,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 6:56 PM,i have some instances where the menu thinks i still have items inside the inventory,,
558719861463842852,glutenfreevapes,07/04/2020 7:07 PM,Do you have a dedicated function for crafting on the server?,,
558719861463842852,glutenfreevapes,07/04/2020 7:09 PM,"Send an RPC from the server to the client when the crafting is successful

137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 10:53 PM,i have a function in playerbase class which is dedicated to removing the items and spawning the new ones,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/04/2020 10:53 PM,bigger problem i'm encountering is that the UI will craft the items inside the last player connected to the server,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/10/2020 10:42 AM,"so if i'd want to play some particles in an area on the map, should i just do it in MissionGameplay?",,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,07/10/2020 10:44 AM,Everyone does their own thing,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,07/10/2020 11:46 AM,@Helkhiana best bet is to attach the particle to an object,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,07/10/2020 11:47 AM,otherwise say you want to spawn a ring of particles then you can do it via an rpc and store them elsewhere,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,07/10/2020 11:47 AM,but be careful with managing the lifetime of the particle then,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,07/10/2020 11:48 AM,yeah thanks. i just made a HND and spawned that with the particle attached,,

I thought RegisterNetSyncVariable would do it?? but don't seem to be synced did I miss something? Or can that not be done will I need RPC calls",,
