84665468828254208,podrivo,05/14/2023 10:35 PM,so it's not possible to trigger emotes right after init? do I have to wait for something to finish loading or a similar thing?,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:19 PM,the line above it is more important,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:21 PM,`ProjectionBasedOnParent` is probably not returning anything or an improper type,,

384850738355896321,ragtyson,05/14/2023 11:22 PM,so the return is correct,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:35 PM,just launch it from your DayZ Exp folder instead,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:44 PM,would also do these here as well,,

384850738355896321,ragtyson,05/14/2023 11:46 PM,because i add paths to dayz.gproj usually,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:47 PM,i use `workbench.exe -mod=@Mod1;@Mod2;@Mod3`,,

384850738355896321,ragtyson,05/14/2023 11:49 PM,but wouldn't that debug the packed mod instead of your build you're working on?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,05/14/2023 11:49 PM,no because of filepatching :widebork:,,

However when you have the weapon raised (at least while standing), it looks like you're faster than walking but slower than jogging.

got a quick question for those who know: where can I find the min and max drop for fillets?
I am working on better fishing for our PvE server and I try to come up with some reasonable prices for gebsfish fishing mod. I asked about the chances on geb's Discord but got not response so I changed things according to the (old) mod description. That left me with lower chances to catch the bigger fish. However, I can't estimate their value for our economy because the fillet number is somewhat random. Cut a few and got everything from 1 to 3 or 2 to 5. I looked on here and found geb's post about the randomization but also a note that says he increased the fillet amount for the Great White shark from 2-6 to 4-6... I've looked in the config.cpp and some random files (not a scripter) and I'm lost. Google keeps showing videos and tutorials for the general CLE...
So, could anyone please tell me where I can find  the settings so I can see what the max. amount of fillets a player can get per fish?",,

For player i used this:
```c
PlayerBase player;
        if (PlayerBase.CastTo(player, GetHierarchyRootPlayer()))
        {
            EntityAI slot_temp = player.GetInventory().FindAttachment(InventorySlots.GetSlotIdFromString(""Race"")); //Get entity from headgear slot

            player.GetInventory().CreateAttachment(""ME_Uruk_Face""); //Give new helmet to player
        }
```
But for my ""building"" ?

I need to attach attachment to my ""building"" through script in similiar way how i did it by a player.

I have ready and working action to my building:

```c
override void OnFinishProgressServer(ActionData action_data)
    {
        action_data.m_Player.GetItemAccessor().HideItemInHands(false);
        float currenthealth = action_data.m_MainItem.GetHealth("""", """");
        action_data.m_MainItem.SetHealth("""", """", (currenthealth - 10));
        Object targetObject3 = action_data.m_Target.GetObject();
        float currenthealth2 = targetObject3.GetHealth("""", """");
        targetObject3.SetHealth("""", """", (currenthealth2 - 0));

        GetGame().ChatPlayer(""[Gondor Farm Was upgraded successfully]"");
      
    }

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 11:51 AM,"Yes, serverside action, getting steam id should work from the player identity and then you just need to have a whitelist in either code or serverside in a text file you read or something. Requires a little scripting but these are the hints you need to implement it.",,"‚úÖ (1),DuckyThankYou (1)"
185896664110727168,osodirty,05/29/2023 12:47 PM,"1st thing I would check is that it's compiling at all. Open one of the .c files, slap the keyboard and get some jibberish in there, pack it and see if it throws a compile error when you start the server.",,
185896664110727168,osodirty,05/29/2023 12:48 PM,"Also, you are testing this on a server, correct? COM is not a reliable script testing environment.",,
