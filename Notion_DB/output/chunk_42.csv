For my server, if I want to override something in `PlayerConstants.c`, would I be able to override the constant in my `init.c`?  Do I use the `override` like in the player spawn declaration?",,

355565030437289994,zysen,10/24/2019 3:15 AM,"Hello All,
I am trying to lock some doors once the server starts up. If i override ActionOpenDoors in 4_World then i can lock,unlock,open,close the doors in that function call.
But if i try and lookup the Building using the below code inside OnMissionStart, it crashes as soon as i call building.LockDoor(doorIndex);
The door index definitely exists.
Is there some timing issue i am unaware of ? Maybe this has to happen inside 4_World?
Any help would be appreciated.
```
array<Object> objects = new array<Object>;
array<CargoBase> cargo = new array<CargoBase>;
GetGame().GetObjectsAtPosition(position, 1, objects, cargo);
if(objects.Count()==1){
    Building building;
    if ( Class.CastTo(building, objects.Get(0)) )

I'd suggest using a text editor like VSCode, Sublime, or Atom while you're scripting, the workbench isn't always reliable and sometimes crashes, leaving your unsaved work in the garbage. Most of your learning is going to be coming from the unpacked game data, which some of the scripting has documentation, and the rest is just a bit of learning from what's written and understanding code flow. You're welcome to ask questions here once you get started, it's what most do.",,

quick question. I know how to spawn my buildings and created bases on the map with loot an zombies and the whole circus.
with the COM editor it is quite easy to do with the //Spawn helper function.
within the editor there is the possibility to despawn items that are already on the map, so it should be possible to add a //DeSpawn helper function as well?
anyone any idea?",,

105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 7:41 PM,"In theory you should be able to mod a ""onmessage"" function",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 7:44 PM,I did that yesterday with the onrpc function (send a message from server to client or the other way around),,

561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:11 PM,You can bind keys with keypress events or custom inputs,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:13 PM,"still wouldn't hurt to have a function that allows me to say: Input.bind(key,function)",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:13 PM,this works nice for 1 or 2 keys 😛,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:14 PM,but when you get a lot meh,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:14 PM,thanks tho !,,

107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/05/2019 11:16 PM,Its what you would want to use for a finished mod for people to use ^^,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:16 PM,so they can rebind them i assume,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/05/2019 11:16 PM,yes,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:17 PM,luckly i only need a keybinding to test stuff 😛,,

107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/05/2019 11:18 PM,just search through the game,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/05/2019 11:18 PM,where most of us picked it up from,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:19 PM,"not exactly, documentation isn't exactly all there, you mainly just have to go through the hierarchy and understand it yourself if it isn't commented",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:19 PM,yeah thats what i am doing. i set everything up last friday. almost got a MVP for a gungame mod,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:20 PM,can we write wiki's on dayz's thing ?,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:22 PM,"but its nice to have, even just as little as what you send is a ""okay start""compared to nothing",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:28 PM,i'd probably use something like sharpDox for a decent output documentation,,
