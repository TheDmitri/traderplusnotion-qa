Not really, the obvious way is to add names to global namespace if they are not declared in any namespace. And resolve names from imported namespaces first.",,

I am struggling to learn how to find the source of what I would need to script, and how variables express some data, or where the source of data would be. As an example, I was looking at the Generator fuel tanks, and overriding the fuel tank amount (not sure I would do this in real life, but just as an exercise). I looked in 4_World/entities/itembase/powergenerator.c

In the file I see m_FuelTankCapacity defined as a private static float, and then further down I see m_FuelTankCapacity = GetGame().ConfigGetFloat (""CfgVehicles "" + GetType() + "" fuelTankCapacity"");

How would I actually find or see the float value of the Fuel Tank capacity. 

I hope this is not too stupid a question just trying to wrap my head around it....",,

GetGame.IsClient() will tell it to print on client if the if is evaluated to `true`. Also I have had issues like this before and I found out that these issues can arise if your client code is on a server sided script like missionServer. So I usually put all my client only code in a file like missionGameplay and it seems to work for me, not sure if its actually the solution but it may help. Not sure if it gets affected when you use custom classes that arent in the base game.",,

I'm making a custom chemlight, it should be always ON, to be use for ambient effects in custom locations. 
I've managed the light, color and all the stuff except the material. in the config.cpp I've used the HiddenSelectionMaterial that point to the correct chemlight_Color_on.rvmat.

But the resulting object ingame look like a white, non-glowing chemlight, but it project light correctly. 
I'm sure I have to set something in the chemlight.c file, but I dontk know what precisely. 

Because the object is not interactive I dont care about all the damaged materials/states, I just want a ""color""-glowing object that emits light...
