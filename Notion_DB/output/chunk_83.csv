272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 9:56 PM,It causes your mods and others to get funky,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:56 PM,`ref` is ONLY needed in Class Properties,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:56 PM,never in local scope,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:56 PM,never in return values,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 9:56 PM,And templates,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:57 PM,"yup, if its the actual storage of the object. it needs to be ref'd",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:57 PM,everything else is just a pointer to that data,,
102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 9:57 PM,Yup... I made that mistake too... and I think Darc made that mistake because he is an embedded programmer... Ref isn't just a pointer (there are a lot of implicit pointers in Enfscript...) Ref is something like std::shared_ptr in C++,,
102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 9:57 PM,So it will lead to memory leaks if you create extra refs,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:58 PM,CF even made this mistake since we didnt understand it,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:58 PM,ref is the actual storage of data. everything else is a pointer,,
102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 9:58 PM,And I borrowed code from Jacob Mango which also misused it 😛,,

272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,only at the compiler stage,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,i hate autoptr. always drives confusion,,
102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,"My understanding was that ref does basic performance calculating, but actually autoptr is what implements those stack based reference counting features like in C++",,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,yeah,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,Be explicit,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 9:59 PM,"hey, did you know that the `Managed` class will automatically clean up all `ref` variables in the class itself on destruction",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/30/2021 10:00 PM,so you dont need to call `delete`,,
102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 10:00 PM,But people would avoid using unique_ptrs in c++ because of poor performance,,

102171754071334912,ralian,03/30/2021 10:03 PM,Maybe occasionally in foreach loops where it's clear what it's doing,,

272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:33 PM,so managed class and autoptr if you want to be lazy,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:36 PM,tbh this could harm way more,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:36 PM,Anything that you store on a autoptr memeber will be deleted when the class die,,

272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:37 PM,Anyway you could achieve the same thing by just making adding a ref in the class that actually created the instance,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:37 PM,and no refs anywhere else,,
272245679013888011,marioe,03/30/2021 10:39 PM,as a class being deleted could make a theaded function suddenly try to access something that doesn't exist,,
