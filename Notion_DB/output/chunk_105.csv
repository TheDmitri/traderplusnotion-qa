After 1.15 my mod ceased to work after roughly 20 minutes because pirave object field that holds reference to object in 3d world become null. I suspect object just despawn and of course reference is null then and crash my mod.

I have simply defined pivate Object field inside my class that holds reference like this:

private Object designatorObject;

And I create object like thus :

designatorObject = GetGame().CreateObject(designatorModels.GetRandomElement(), areaPosition);

Afeter while designatorObject became null and I suspect 3d object probably despawns. What is strange it started after 1.15 and only on hosted live server (probably running linux dayz server?) I am not able to reproduce it localy on my test server.

I made it so you can't detach any vehicle parts if they are NOT ruined.
However, i need to check if the vehicle battery is empty and if so, you can detach it then.
```c
modded class VehicleBattery : ItemBase
{
    override bool CanDetachAttachment(EntityAI parent)
    {
        if ( GetGame().IsServer() )
        {
            ItemBase battery;
            float battery_capacity = battery.GetCompEM().GetEnergyMax();
                
            if ( battery.GetCompEM().GetEnergy() && battery_capacity == 0 )
            {
                return true;
            }

        {
            return true;

181864632216977408,arkensor,11/27/2021 5:09 PM,"if your mod was focused on no lockpick in safezone you check ""am i in a safezone, then false - otherwise super""",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/27/2021 5:10 PM,"with your logic you respect other mods that might change it, but it could also be a mod that has a simple rule of ""you can only lockpick if its at full health"". that one would return true, and allow lockpicking in the safezone",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/27/2021 5:11 PM,"i'd say that when ever your logic not getting respected is a major problem and or defeats the purpose of your mod as a whole, your logic goes first.",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/27/2021 5:13 PM,"for the example of ""no lockpick in safezone"" ... but friends are allowed they either a) need a different mod that does both or b) either mod has to work with the other one explicitly to resolve this specific arrangement or c) via loadorder you say that friend lockpicks always work, because they are on top of everything, and only if its not a friend lockpick the rest of the logic applies",,
