236210116859396096,kreyu,12/17/2018 8:19 PM,"hey all. I have a question(s), trying to learn how's it all working.
I added additional volume control in the menu to default `sound_tabs.layout`.
And looks like I have to modify the `optionsmenusounds.c` file, to use new .layout and bind the volume variable somewhere.
Apparently, I noticed the options are stored/received by the ID constants like AT_OPTIONS_MASTER_VOLUME - is it possible to create a new one somewhere, so the game will save/load the value of the new option?

And still I don't fully understand how the ""modded"" works. If I create modded class and existing method in it, I'm overriding the base one or adding stuff to it? (idk how that would work lol)",,
236210116859396096,kreyu,12/17/2018 8:20 PM,"Like, I don't even know if I'm going in right direction with that, lol",,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,12/17/2018 8:25 PM,if you override it you should call super to call the original method,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,12/17/2018 8:29 PM,Off the top of my head something like this,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,12/17/2018 8:29 PM,"```modded class thing{

    override void init(params){
        super.init(params)
        //Your stuff goes here
    }

}```",,
236210116859396096,kreyu,12/17/2018 8:32 PM,"so if I have base class `class OptionsMenuSounds  extends ScriptedWidgetEventHandler` and I want to add something to its `void Revert()` method, i should go:

```
modded class OptionsMenuSounds  // extends here as well?
{
    ...
    override void Revert() {}
}
```

like that? I think I tried that, and gave me error that base class does not have `void Revert` method, and I thought that it's only to override extended class methods",,
