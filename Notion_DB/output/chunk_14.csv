The problem is this: I need to change one mechanic in the game. 
I found a function that is responsible for it. 
It's got type ""proto native"". 
As I understand it - this is the native function of the engine and I cannot change it directly. 
Based on this, I concluded that i need to write my own function, include it and replace the native function call with mine wherever it is. 
And then the question arose - where and how to write my own function?
Should I do this in files that are in scripts? Or in some config? 
It's about changing the door actions.
I would be very grateful for the answer.",,

207328818203983872,notabanana,12/06/2018 9:52 PM,pls tell more,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,12/06/2018 9:53 PM,"Danny said something about a cache you can rewrite but with that method you cant have multiple mods with custom recipes, that's not how you guys fixed it right?",,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:53 PM,pretty sure you can have multiple mod with a custom recipe,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,12/06/2018 9:53 PM,So you guys arent doing the cache way?,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:54 PM,well,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:54 PM,it uses the cache,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:54 PM,but im pretty sure it would work wiht multiple mods,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,12/06/2018 9:55 PM,"The way heexplained it, you can rebuild the cache, but can't add to it, so mod 1 would rebuild, it's recipes would be added, then mod 2 would come along and rebuild and undo the build mod 1 did",,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:55 PM,My method forces the cache to be rebuilt instead of read from the file.,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:56 PM,So any mod can include the overridden method and it will rebuild the cache for all registered recipies,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:57 PM,"```modded class PluginRecipesManager {
    override void ReadCacheFromFile(string filename) {

    }
}```",,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:57 PM,so as long as each recipe mod containts it,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:57 PM,it continues to rebuild the cache with all other mods till they all load,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,12/06/2018 9:57 PM,Ahh ok cool,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:57 PM,Not quite kuro,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,oh?,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,how does it work,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,or does the game no longer load mods in an order,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,This method is not mod specific,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,it just prevents the cache file from loading,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:58 PM,and instead uses a freshly generated one,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:59 PM,"so it doesnt matter which mod is loaded last, as long as this method isnt being overridden differently",,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 9:59 PM,the actual registering takes place via RegisterRecipie();,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 10:00 PM,but doesnt it need to generate the cache with all of the mods loaded?,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 10:00 PM,and if the first mod regenerates the cache,,
188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,12/06/2018 10:00 PM,"it does, but that comes last, no matter what",,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,12/06/2018 10:00 PM,then the other mods recipes wont be regenerated,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,12/07/2018 4:29 AM,Short answer: you cant,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/07/2018 4:36 AM,Well what you could do is an automated copy/update batch command. That would grab players.db from one server to another so it matches. But that still would not work. So wait for official support,,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:02 AM,does anyone know if its possible to create GetGame(). based functions with modding?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:03 AM,DayZGame class is different and GetGame refers to CGame but i don't think thats moddable,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:04 AM,want to create some deeply implemented functions that is accessible from everywhere,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:04 AM,"but havent really done this before, and the engine classes cant be modded",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:06 AM,oh it can be extended,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:06 AM,not sure if thats gonna be good,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:07 AM,nah nope its not,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:37 AM,GetGame just returns the current game class,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:37 AM,Which is g_Game,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:37 AM,That is defined somewhere in 3_Game,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:38 AM,And the class is DayZGame.,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:38 AM,You can change g_Game to anything you wish,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:38 AM,But you can only run 1 game class at a time,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:40 AM,@Corey you could implement your functions that you wish to use “across the whole module” by just defining them in the game main class,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:40 AM,g_Game which is DayZGame.c,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:40 AM,"There is better ways to go about it, but that should work any way",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:44 AM,yeah problem is i cant mod g_Game only DayZGame,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:44 AM,and DayZGame functions are not accessible by GetGame(),,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:46 AM,i want to make similar level functions like GetGame().GetWeather() etc,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:46 AM,because that shit is accessible from all the classes,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:46 AM,but haven't figured out yet how to do that because most of the base classes  are core,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 3:47 AM,g_Game can be accessed from anywhere I believe,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:56 AM,hm yeah something is happening,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:56 AM,i was trying to access functions by GetGame(),,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:57 AM,but if i mod DayZGame i can access those functiosn with g_Game.MyFunc(),,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:57 AM,or looks like it needs more testing,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:57 AM,"i want to make an in-detail logging system for all my game systems like traders, hit / kill logs, connection, authentication etc data",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 3:59 AM,"but want to finish the traider voices first, because this shit is absolutely not working as it was before",,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:02 AM,but fucking createSoundON is not working,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:13 AM,They changed how create sound works,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:14 AM,"There’re more to it now, have to make some memes. Have a look at some actions with sounds",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:14 AM,GetGame() for sure should return g_Game,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:14 AM,Why do you want to put it in GetGame?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:14 AM,Like it makes no sense,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:14 AM,Better access to it he says,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:15 AM,"```C

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:15 AM,if you create class Logger you can access it anywhere anytime?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:16 AM,As long as you put it in the right scope,,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,i know that,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,Or you could construct the class every time you want to use it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,yeah but i dont want to,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,thats why  i wanted to use g_Game,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,i can access g_Game anywhere above 3_game,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,static functions?,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,also am i wrong but cant you also just make global functions that dont have static?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,"You could use a module system, in there extended all your class based on it. And you log functions can be in your module manager",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:17 AM,i think i tried that and it worked before,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:18 AM,You can ofc,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:18 AM,yea just not good to do tho,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:19 AM,also @DaOne(Mark) the new sound scripts are purely client side unfortunately. so if u dont want to have to deal with syncing you'll have to use SoundOnVehicle while we wait for them to do something about it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:19 AM,also by this i can do g_Game.Faszomanyadba anywhere,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/520801482405314560/unknown.png,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,i mod missionServer in about 3-4 files,,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,that makes me scared,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,of losing more hope,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,-servermod is still not a thing,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,it works,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,"that this prototype ""game"" actually worth something",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:37 AM,yeah -servermod is not a thing,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:38 AM,confirmed,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,12/08/2018 4:38 AM,I mod MissionServer and MissionGameplay in all 3 of my mods I've released,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:38 AM,sound plays for like 2-3 seconds then stops,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,12/08/2018 4:38 AM,oh -servermod doesn't work but that's a talk for a different channel,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:38 AM,@Jacob_Mango new addition as last time i did it i got a big juicy CTD,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,i get most of my crashes when scripting from wrong strings,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,i think this issue only occurs when u call it on server,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,i send information to my adminpanel from the servere and something corrupts the string,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,I still wonder why -servermod is not a thing,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,and the game likes to crash,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:39 AM,what do you mean @Danny 🌭 ? the sound?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:40 AM,createsoundonobject,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:40 AM,cuz when i was using it,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:40 AM,i was calling it on client with create_local = true,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:40 AM,and it was working fine,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:40 AM,"it was working previously for me as well, no matter what if it was local or not",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,simply called server side and thats it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,but i guess i have to find a workaround,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,"and the thing is, i already made a function that triggers the sound on client side",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,the function does get executed,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,but the sound doesnt play,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,and that was strictly clientsided,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,same effect,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,Ok i have an idea,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,ill try again spawning it on client side with create_local = true,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:41 AM,Do this a dll that plays the sound natively,,

334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:47 AM,@Danny 🌭 i'll share some info about it how to do it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,but its working,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,I have a feeling ill need to have a stupid object binded to trader cities,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,:REEEE:,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,ik how to do it. but yea put it in wiki,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,And than how you access that object without doing nearstuff call,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:48 AM,Class.WhateverGetFunction(),,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,But that wont do anything,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,you have to write return classes for the object,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,As if you are not in range of it it will be null,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,anytime you use SetSyncDirty whatever it will update on clients,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,and i think it buffers as well,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,because i set data when i wasnt connected to the server,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/08/2018 4:49 AM,and after connecting i received the fresh data,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:50 AM,yes because OnVariablesSynchronized is called when u enter the network bubble,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/08/2018 4:50 AM,not just setsyncdirty,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/08/2018 4:50 AM,But it only supports Int Float and Bool?,,
