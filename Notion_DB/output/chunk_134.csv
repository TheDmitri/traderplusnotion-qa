665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,10/29/2022 7:07 AM,your formatting is horrible on the eyes. every time there is a { the next line needs to be indented by a tab. And for everything { you also need a } to close it.,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/29/2022 7:07 AM,"i'm sorry about this guys. I am trying my best. I get that this is out of my league. honestly i just want a message so i can easily see when i do something that works, if that is to much i'll leave it till a later datre",,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:08 AM,Sorry I'm on my phone...,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:11 AM,"As zed said, just look at the open/closes to begin with, and what it's asking for.

Top { is red, meaning it doesn't have a }

And it can't find the PlayerMessage function because you removed the ""void PlayerMessage"" section.",,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:12 AM,"Void eekilled has a { but no }, so it takes the next following. And so on.
So the class one doesn't have one at the end.",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,10/29/2022 7:12 AM,Thus why formatting is visually important.,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:16 AM,"So if you add a } to line 7, and add the void PlayerMessage from above, keeping it within the top { and bottom }; and outside of other voids, it should at least compile.",,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:19 AM,"To get it to actually use that code, youll need to add a line between line 5 and 6, and do like...
```
MessageAll(killer.something to do with a string);
```
On that line.",,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,10/29/2022 7:20 AM,"Or like...
MessageAll(""test message"");",,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/29/2022 7:21 AM,"ok, sorry for the frustration. really appreciate the help.",,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/29/2022 7:28 AM,it works 🙂 Much appreciated. first order of buisness is to understand how and why it works and re write it neatly formatted,,

270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/30/2022 12:58 AM,so i need to have the array saved in the missionserver and then access it through zombie base,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 12:58 AM,so basically you wanna set up your array there and then in zombiebase you will still have this reporting function where the zed died,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 12:59 AM,well that is not going to quite work,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 12:59 AM,"because mission server is in 5th layer, while zedbase is in 4th i guess",,

270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/30/2022 1:00 AM,so i need a spot in the 4th llayer to store an array?,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:00 AM,you can use mission class as well,,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:05 AM,an option you have is to have a reference set in each zombie to missionserver since you are spawning them in,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:06 AM,mission server or whatever the location of your custom spawning script / data array,,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:07 AM,here's another option,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:08 AM,"make your own class, have all your custom spawning inside it, including the data array and then you can make a getter function for that class so you don't need any refs",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:08 AM,so example,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:09 AM,ZombieSpawner GetZombieSpawner() {return myZombieSpawnerInstance;},,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:09 AM,than you can use inside the zombie's death GetZombieSpawner().OnDeath(); (in which function you can send all the info needed),,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,10/30/2022 1:10 AM,then the only thing you need to do in missionserver is creating an instance of this zombiespawner,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,10/30/2022 1:10 AM,"ok, you make it sound so simple. i have all this noted down for when it is in my capacity to attempt",,

That way you can have your base scripts in your rock base. And only override what you need in the rest. also check the minerock action to make sure your objects meet the conditions in that action.,,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 12:39 PM,alr so that worked...now back to why defs from other mods don't....,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 12:43 PM,Perhaps you guys know any mods that test #ifdef for other mods? Maybe I can figure out and learn from examples,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 12:55 PM,As far as I know scripts are either loaded depending on required addons or if nothing is specified by the prefix part of the mod containing the scripts. Something with prefix 0 will always be loaded first and something with z last. What is your prefix and what is the prefix of the mod containing the ifdef you try to catch?,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 12:57 PM,That's why cf and such have their Defs in a dedicated pbo with prefix 0_something,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 12:58 PM,well....i'm trying to get DeerIsle's define (in scripts.pbo)  in a TestMod.pbo,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,11/02/2022 12:58 PM,It's sort of irrelevant if you're adding the path to your defs..,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 12:59 PM,That's the name of the Pbos but what is the prefix of the Pbos?,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,11/02/2022 12:59 PM,Can use my dynamic AI add-on as an example if you like. I do a few different ones in it.,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:00 PM,where do i find this prefix?,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:00 PM,is it like name in CfgMods?,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,Typically it's the path that's used to pack the mod,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,yea so deer isle's dir is deerisle\scripts,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,mine is just testmod,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,Also on another side note: if the define is only set in 4_world it won't be present in 5_mission,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,yea...that'd be the issue then,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:01 PM,i thought 5_ would see 4_,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:02 PM,The classes yes but not the defines,,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:02 PM,will do,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:03 PM,Look at cf for example. CF explicitly adds the path containing the c file with defines to all 5 defs for exactly that reason,,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:17 PM,If it works it works. I also did that once to create a soft dependency when the the prefix was not an option,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:19 PM,i guess...but i always try to find out what the correct way of doing it is..,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:20 PM,i think there's probably a way to do it without it which would be the best,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:24 PM,It depends how the mod that provides the define did it though,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:24 PM,If the mod didn't do it right you can't do it either,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:25 PM,And if this is the og source code there are 2 issues in there already. Not speaking about the define but the ref keyword,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,11/02/2022 1:26 PM,We don't discuss deerisle in public.. 😉,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,11/02/2022 1:27 PM,"I don't want to either. Just pointing the fact of ""doing something the correct way"" when the other party doesn't",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:40 PM,but you said the best way to do it is to have defines in separate pbo with a low value prefix?,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:40 PM,so it's priority is above other things,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:41 PM,asking for my own projects,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,11/02/2022 1:41 PM,to make it easier for myself in the future,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,11/02/2022 1:42 PM,A define needs to be defined in ALL modules in order for it to function correctly. An easy easy way to do this would be to create a script in core. Or to scripts/0_shared/ folder with a single file containing your defines. Then in the config file the shared folder should be added on all 5 script modules in the file array.,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,11/02/2022 1:44 PM,Off the top of my head I would say look at HDSM_BreachingCharges mod for an example,,
