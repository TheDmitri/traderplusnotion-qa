135355238990348288,djctavia,05/10/2019 9:40 PM,"Well, I can't do debug phases that last 3 years to debug a simple reference. Then a little help would be greatly appreciated!

Someone would be able to explain to me the reason for a pointer that is NULL when the array in question uses a ""ref"" and its members as well? I really have that impression there are things that have trouble compiling, the code only returned NULL points, I recompile without touching the code, launch the server and the client, and it works, but in the logs always the same pointer line with an error when everything is displayed as I hoped. I recompile, and again a pointer problem but this time I no longer have the display of what I expect.

Concretely I point to a class reference, at its creation I use a ""string"" to fill a member variable which is also a ""string"" type.

To initialize a new class in my array I do this:

```
// This one is inside another class but for understanding I put it there as an exemple
ref array<ref PM_playerInList> myArray = new ref array<ref PM_playerInList>;
// There is code beyond but don't mind
ref PM_playerInList n_player;

        while (element_index < playersArray.Count())
        {
            n_player = new ref PM_playerInList(playersArray[element_index+1]);
            myArray.Insert(n_player );
// etc...
```
This is a simplified example, so I doubt I'm stupid I've been programming for a while, but I'm starting to wonder about enscript, with the ""ref"" I thought I'd use them as standard pointers that can be found more or less in C, but I clearly have the impression that it's totally random every time I compile and test phases on large modules.

If someone would at least have the idea of the reason for the NULL pointer when everything is initialized, that would be really nice.",,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,05/10/2019 9:46 PM,@NiiRoZz All working now no config changes needed. Just override RegisterActions and call AddAction on the target. Aces 😄,,

135355238990348288,djctavia,05/10/2019 9:56 PM,"To better explain my situation:

I create a mother class that will be called everywhere in my mod. This class contains a member variable that is a class of type ""ref PM_dictionary<ref PM_playerInList>"". It is a creation almost equivalent to ""map<T1, T2>"".

When I initialize the mother class I create the reference for ""ref PM_dictionary<ref PM_playerInList>"". When a player joins the server, his ID and Name are stored in an ""array<string>"" pasted together. (In the example above, this is in case a new player joins and wants to get the name and ID of the others).

In the function called to retrieve their ID and Name, I loop through ""array<string>"". I record the elements in my dictionary as follows: ""myDictionary.set(String, ref PM_playerInList)"".

The ""Set"" method allows me to find the existing value of the String or to create it in the dictionary.

From there I'm supposed to be able to access it. But I have pointer returns equivalent to NULL. I'm sure my variables should initialize correctly, I put Print everywhere, everything works as expected, except in a function in a separate class that calls on the parent class to retrieve the information.

Sorry for the long sentence, but it's not easy to explain everything simply. :thinkgun:",,

```
// Used before
ref array<ref Class> myArray = new ref array<ref Class>;

143064562332073984,[Rec] M Broderick#2967,05/12/2019 12:26 PM,Just wanted some ideas of like something to try. I have a idea for a mod but I think it’s going to be too complicated to start off with. Just need to make a simple script like where is my player and update every 5 mins or something to get used to the code. Am I best to activate the script via the init or to make a key press command ?,,

Start by grabbing an IDE like VSCode and unpack the *scripts.pbo*. That is pretty much the first barrier of entry to scripting. Pilfer through those files, along with the provided server files, and figure out the lifecycle of the server/game. Each component you try to modify has a learning curve that will take some time to understand. Start off slow and make something small. If you want to spawn an item, search the source code or discord for keywords. The default server files pretty much tell you how to spawn items in `init.c`. A lot of implementations and lessons learned are in these channels, so look for them first before delving into whatever you want to tackle next.",,
