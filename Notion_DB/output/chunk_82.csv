135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:56 AM,theres a few ways you could do it,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:56 AM,the simplest way to do it imo is a combination of scripting and using the events.xmlk,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:56 AM,you create a dummy Object that you consider to be your'event object',,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:56 AM,name the object `MyCustomEvent` and set it in your Events,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:57 AM,"then, on the constructor of `MyCustomEvent` spawn the rest of your items that you need for the event to work",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:57 AM,"```
class MyCustomEvent: House
{
    void MyCustomEvent()
    {
        // Create your objects here, store them, and remove them in the destructor
        GetGame().CreateObject();...
    }
}```",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:58 AM,so you leverage the CE's event system without overcomplicating it,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/18/2021 12:58 AM,or you can just go into MissionServer and create a Timer than runs ever X minutes and spawns your objects somewhere on the map.,,

Instead, you have to call `DayZCreatureAI::InitAIAgent` on the object after creating it. This method takes an `AIGroup` as an argument and it isn't entirely clear how to properly create/get the right `AIGroup` instance, but `AIWorld::CreateDefaultGroup` seems to work (I'm not sure if that's right, though)",,

106922508707434496,thecrimsonzamboni,03/20/2021 3:14 PM,"My next question is about spawning objects with attachments. Obviously, one can create an object and then call `obj.GetInventory().CreateAttachment(...)` to do this, but I would like to have the attachments determined by `cfgspawnabletypes.xml` and `cfgrandompresets.xml`. It appears as though `cargo` presets are honored when creating objects with `CreateObjectEx` (and `CreateObject`), but `attachments` presets are not honored. I was hoping that the `ECE_EQUIP_ATTACHMENTS` spawn flag would correct this issue, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Is this the expected behavior? Have I misunderstood the purpose of the `ECE_EQUIP_ATTACHMENTS` flag?",,
106922508707434496,thecrimsonzamboni,03/20/2021 3:16 PM,Thanks! I'll give that a try. It's strange that they didn't define an `ECE_` constant for that flag...,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:42 PM,yes client will follow server order,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:42 PM,ifdef doesn't force the loading,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:42 PM,which is why it's not reliable,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:42 PM,the only thing that will force another mod to be loaded before yours is using requiredAddons,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:44 PM,"depending which mod you're trying to use ifdef on, there's a workaround for forcing loading order",,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 12:44 PM,but it can be dangerous,,
143322866127994880,handsomenipple,03/25/2021 12:53 PM,"An example for what I'm trying to do would be this: 
```c++
void DestroyLocks(Object target)
{
        if(target.GetType() == ""Fence"")
        {
            Fence fence = Fence.Cast(target); 
            CombinationLock combinationLock = fence.GetCombinationLock();
            
            if(combinationLock)
            {
                //combinationLock.UnlockServer(placingPlayer, target);
                combinationLock.DestroyLock();
            }
            
#ifdef CodeLock
            
            CodeLock codeLock = fence.GetCodeLock();
            
            if(codeLock)
            {
                //codeLock.UnlockServer(placingPlayer, target);
                codeLock.Delete();
            }
            
#endif 
        }
}```
In this case I want the codelock mod as an optional mod, no actual dependencies, just that in case the mod is loaded I want my mod to also check for codelocks, I could probably get around it in this code by writing some separate functions but I also want to do similar stuff with BBP, SimpleBase and Expansion, at some points I would have to use specific classes/methods of those mods and add modded classes which wouldn't really work otherwise",,
143322866127994880,handsomenipple,03/25/2021 12:55 PM,"I could also just add the ""extra"" code as its own mod and modify my own classes, but I'd prefer it to all just be one mod",,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 1:02 PM,this will get rid of the warning message and if you use ifdefs then your code will still not execute unless the real codelock was loaded,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 1:02 PM,because real one has the defines,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/25/2021 1:04 PM,i'm not sure if you can use this all the time in public mods because there can be loop dependency happening at some point. i don't recommend it unless you know 100% it's gonna be fine,,
