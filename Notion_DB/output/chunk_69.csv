297602375865335808,Kat#3991,10/29/2020 12:03 AM,So I'm trying to put the Pumpkin helmets on the zombies for Halloween. I have them spawning on the zombies but it will consistently crash my server in around 30 minutes. I added a attachment class to the random presents and added that preset to the spawnable types. Is there something I did wrong?,,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:13 AM,Whatt why would you do that ? you just have to change the hats attachments on randompresets,,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:13 AM,you don't need to add anything else on spawnable types,,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:15 AM,"Inside cfgrandompresets, under each zombie types (farm, village, city, etc.) you change or you add a line 

""<item name=""PumpkinHelmet"" chance=""0.00"" /> "" and you change the chance values by what you want thats it",,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:16 AM,"If you add an extra attachment class it will probably try to override on zombies that already got an helmet and lead to crash, actually",,

312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:19 AM,"You might delete the zombie.bin inside your server storage folder too, tho, just in case some zombie got the attachment override saved or whatever",,
297602375865335808,Kat#3991,10/29/2020 12:19 AM,"Ah, that would make sense why it works for a bit then crashes",,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:20 AM,"Yes, spawnable types are used only when you want items spawned inside items or buildings actually, zombies are not items tho",,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:20 AM,i mean not the same way,,
297602375865335808,Kat#3991,10/29/2020 12:21 AM,Its just odd since I changed the existing preset to the one I made for specific zombies and only ones that already had configs for hats,,
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:22 AM,Well i guess the easiest way is to set them on categorized zombies and not on individual one by one,,
297602375865335808,Kat#3991,10/29/2020 12:25 AM,Either way thanks for helping me. Im gonna try what you said later when server dies down a bit,,✌🏼 (1)
312948232021868545,landum,10/29/2020 12:26 AM,"No prob, i runs my server with zombie pumpkin heads for 2 days and it runs smoothly
Just only modify hats inside cfgrandompresets and remove your modifications about pumpkin helmets inside spawnable types you'll see",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,10/31/2020 9:37 AM,Because sleep should not be used. Instead register a callback in the CallLater queue for one second,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/31/2020 9:38 AM,Depending on where you put the sleep it won't work or will freeze the game,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,10/31/2020 10:02 AM,typically ill just call `thread MyFunction()` and put `Sleep` within that function,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:25 AM,i havent played around with actions at all so i can't give you much more than that. but look into how the flashlight integrates actions,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:26 AM,i've been messing around with it for a couple of days already,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:33 AM,that looks good. how are you adding your action to your gas canister object?,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:34 AM,wait,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:34 AM,oh i see what you're doing,,

222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:35 AM,yeah,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:35 AM,the gas cannister is full of energy,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:35 AM,the torch has none,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:35 AM,but should be able to use the energy from the cannister,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:35 AM,this is what this code is doing. atleast,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:36 AM,i am wondering if it's the action conditions not being met because the torch isnt using the cannisters energy,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:36 AM,the gas torch will manage the energy. not the cannister,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:36 AM,ie not plugged in,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:36 AM,the 'battery' in this scenario is quite dumb in the sense that it only defines how much juice it has,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:37 AM,so i would think that `item` is our gastorch in this case,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:37 AM,do some printing and see what data you have / reach in these conditions,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:39 AM,ok thanks,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:40 AM,the action will need to go onto the `gastorch` not the cannister.,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:40 AM,"think batteries with your flashlight. they dont put the action on the battery, but they do on the flashlight",,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:42 AM,i have it on both,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:42 AM,tried seperately no good,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:44 AM,i also want to use the cannister to refill my lighter eventually,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:45 AM,"rifle_base has the action to switch on weapon flashlights, not the flashlight itself",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:45 AM,correct yes. im talking about the handleheld flashlight,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:46 AM,guns have it because you wouldnt want to take off the flashlight to turn it on for a gun. you want to do it on the gun itself,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:47 AM,"so you're saying i have to do it the opposite way, have the torch in hand with a slot for the cannister",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:47 AM,yes exactly,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:48 AM,i'm concerned one way or another the character wont be holding something correctly in that scenario,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:50 AM,"at the least, get the actions working in the first place. then play around with it once you understand it a bit more 😛",,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:50 AM,that's fair,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:51 AM,"i have a blowtorch and lighter with custom actions that work fine, but they use their own energy",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:51 AM,energymanager is going to be similar to working with it like that,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:51 AM,you just have a slot that it can draw from,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:52 AM,"alright, not the other way around seemingly",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 9:52 AM,which should be handled internally by the EnergyManager itself,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:53 AM,cool,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:54 AM,i'll go and set it up the other way because im interested if that fixes it,,
222711381210824704,quadley,11/03/2020 9:55 AM,it does make sense it's just rather do it this way i guess 😛,,

292234618667663361,kyhbka,11/03/2020 12:49 PM,I tried creating a full size map widget inside a smaller widget and just moving it around with `SetPos` but it didn't work because the map size wasn't limited to the borders of the parent widget ),,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 1:10 PM,@Кастет mapwidget is broken. If you want all the functions within it to work properly it needs to take up 100% of your screen. Otherwise its super scuffed (atleast for me),,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 1:10 PM,I know COT and VPP have windowed maps but I don't think they use those methods,,

292234618667663361,kyhbka,11/03/2020 1:12 PM,I think there must be a better way than calculating offsets,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 1:19 PM,You'd want the flame to be a hidden section in the torch. No reason to have it in the canister,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 1:19 PM,Enable the torch light when then EM is switched on,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/03/2020 1:19 PM,Cannister is just a battery with a different model,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,11/05/2020 1:06 PM,Being able to add map stuff without perf impact would be the single greatest fix/change BI could do for me imo,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,11/05/2020 1:10 PM,hm weird,,

142681545159737345,taiwendo,11/08/2020 4:11 AM,okay 😆,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,11/08/2020 4:11 AM,to fix it need to remove int rnd_SpawnLoadout,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,11/08/2020 4:12 AM,well or remove override but then at the compilation stage you will get an error,,
