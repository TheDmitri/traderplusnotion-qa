579210937035390976,teddysammler,08/18/2020 5:31 AM,Hey. Is there any way to create script that check the sign from the pbo? To save the pbo from copying and resign?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/18/2020 5:47 AM,What? Are you trying to prevent someone from unpacking your pbo and then repack it as theirs and sign it as theirs?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/18/2020 5:48 AM,There will always be a way to copy and pirate your code. Best you can do is Obfuscate it with mikero tools.,,
