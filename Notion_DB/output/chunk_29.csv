241303613106946048,tannerng,04/24/2019 12:57 AM,@[IntenZ] QuickZ I believe the ref keyword just defines the variable as a pointer. You shouldn't need it to gain access to a variable of the class you're modding.,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,04/24/2019 6:44 AM,Ok so it sounds like it actually is similair to how its normaly useed in c#. Its just that i see the ref keyword beeing used like never before when i read through scripts. And it always looks excessive.  Also there is a *reference* keyword. Confusing 🙂,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:37 PM,Anyone already tried to create dll for DayZ ?,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:38 PM,@NiiRoZz Not possible to load them from client or server at the moment,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:39 PM,"meh, wanted to create something that can be only created with dll",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:39 PM,😔,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:39 PM,"ya, there's also some stuff that I want to do with dlls too",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:39 PM,"But alas, we cannot yet!",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/24/2019 1:40 PM,I certainly hope never without intense security scrutiny,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/24/2019 1:40 PM,opening up to dll files opens so many potentially bad injection methods,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:40 PM,"I hope it's like arma, where you have to go through BattlEye and get your .dlls whitelisted before they can even be launched via the client (whilst the client is running BE)",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:41 PM,Yeah BE system was secure as good,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:41 PM,but sometimes BE whitelist your dll even you don't ask them,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:41 PM,that was a security fail,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/24/2019 1:41 PM,BE can be bypassed though,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:42 PM,I sent a request around 7/8 months ago to BE for arma 3... still no response 😄,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/24/2019 1:42 PM,"and by the current hacking scene, quite easily",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:42 PM,Yeah even now it's easy to bypass BE dude,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:42 PM,Dll was just designed to open a lot more possibility in modding,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:43 PM,"I mean, yeah it's easy to bypass BE. But if you include *.dlls into some-kind of signature check it should be very secure then",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/24/2019 1:44 PM,dll is the only system missing inside modding for DayZ,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:44 PM,"Exactly, with dll support I could remove the need for quite a few engine-side changes for what I want to do",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/24/2019 1:47 PM,I agree,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/24/2019 1:47 PM,"I've never, and i mean never seen their way be abused",,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/24/2019 1:48 PM,I assume part of the reason its not supported is because of the experience from arma,,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/24/2019 1:49 PM,"Also armas situation is quite different since their modding structure, script and configs worked differently than what we have on dayz now",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/24/2019 1:50 PM,Both of wich are really not ideal solutions,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/24/2019 1:51 PM,Anything in regards to persistency that goes beyond what the current hive serializers allows is not really a thing,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/24/2019 1:51 PM,And we will certainly not save everything to json if thats avoidable,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/24/2019 1:52 PM,Not to forget about other services that are not database saving,,

Specifically I’ve noticed that if I teleport away and come back a second or so later a pig will drop about 10ft to its previous approx location whereas one of your chickens looks like it’s been happily carrying on its life while I was away. I need to do more testing to find a pattern but wondered if it was something you’d come across?,,

180029119638011904,lbmaster,05/03/2019 4:05 PM,@rVn is it possible that multiple RPCs at the Same time interfere when manipulating Objects ? Or are network Messages not handled in multiple Threads ?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/03/2019 4:06 PM,All RPC script calls are single threaded (AFAIK) so you shouldn't have any issues @LBmaster,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/03/2019 4:07 PM,And yeah I don't know how I couldn't see the comments before but I see them now. Nice job and thank you for the further documentation!,,
180029119638011904,lbmaster,05/03/2019 4:08 PM,@Jacob_Mango that would mean if I block an incomming RPC Message with a while(true) loop no further Messages can be received ? At least that's my understanding of handling something only in one thread,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/03/2019 4:09 PM,If you put a while true there you'll freeze the game,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/08/2019 6:48 AM,What are you looking to do with that @DjCtavia ?,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,05/08/2019 6:50 AM,I just wanted to get the players' positions as they move to optimize the display of a HUD,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,05/08/2019 6:50 AM,Maybe I went to far for this lol,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/08/2019 9:06 AM,Yeah sync of player positions has been made in lower position inside the engine,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,05/08/2019 9:08 AM,or tried to hack the current database engine inside Enfusion ?,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,05/08/2019 10:05 AM,Remember in past somebody manage to create a pseudo database in JSON or shit like that ?,,

But its my initial plan. Worth noting is that Im only interested in storing extracted DayZ data.",,

207328818203983872,notabanana,05/08/2019 10:33 AM,Is there anything that wasnt doable without modifying by just modding where the constants are used? Does that change just simplify things or does it open doors ?,,

Even though someone said ""well its a constant"". :>",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,05/08/2019 10:33 AM,Are there classes that use constants you cant mod?,,
