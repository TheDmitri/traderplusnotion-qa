94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:04 AM,its starts where it left off,,
558583042755526657,freaksv20#8102,01/15/2020 10:04 AM,hold on I'll copy and past the setting,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:05 AM,I think its already commented in your config,,

94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:14 AM,its still readable,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:15 AM,at server restart. get current systemtime. add/subtract 12h.,,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/15/2020 10:15 AM,"a bit of a workaround freaks, if you have a batch file or something you start server with, you can have the batch file edit your server config to enter current machine time minus 12 hrs. then launch server.",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/15/2020 10:15 AM,but how do you do that programatically quick?,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:15 AM,I would assume you can do it in init,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:16 AM,check for beeing run on server ofc,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:16 AM,Or if it has to be done with a servermod. Not sure since I have not changed the ingametime with scripts. I already have mods for that,,

558583042755526657,freaksv20#8102,01/15/2020 10:20 AM,let me guess evverytime I restart it will take that time and throw the persistent off,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,01/15/2020 10:21 AM,you can choose the time it had when closing the restart if you wish. its up to you,,
