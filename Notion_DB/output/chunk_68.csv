239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:51 PM,"If you Raycast something, it might not have a base type or a cfg entry",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:52 PM,So what you could do is `GetGame().GetModelName(GetType());` when your raycast hits,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,10/28/2020 4:52 PM,Hopefully I will find some good solution 🙂,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:52 PM,Should be able to pull info on the raw p3d name,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,10/28/2020 4:52 PM,Many thanks for these hints !,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:55 PM,"Actually a better way, more consistent and gets you a result:
`proto string ConfigGetString(string entryName);` `class Object`

`object.ConfigGetString(""model"")` will get you the exact path",,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:58 PM,`Howto detect these unnamed objects on map?`,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,10/28/2020 4:58 PM,yea its also part of this,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:58 PM,"Raycasting, then using that method on the object to get its model name OR model path which is almost always there",,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,10/28/2020 4:59 PM,"ok, when I get some model name or path, thats mean some object is there and need selaect another random place",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 4:59 PM,"I mean if you are spawning these things on server start or even after, you could raycast in a 360 degree circle on the position at a short distance to check hit objects",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/28/2020 5:00 PM,"You can also give this a try: `MiscGameplayFunctions.IsUnderRoof( Object, 2 );`",,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,10/28/2020 5:01 PM,"oh, another very useful hint, thanks!",,

356744388447043584,s4mt3k,10/28/2020 6:28 PM,naaah ^^ I mean a function. `actiontarget.getObject()`isnt working... for example,,
144973944271798272,mandibull,10/28/2020 6:28 PM,or you can try casting it to a specific class (House in your case probably),,
356744388447043584,s4mt3k,10/28/2020 6:30 PM,"hah, that was the keyword",,
