123544940524339204,captainchunck,10/02/2020 12:05 AM,You could do it at like 21 fps and use a MP4 to jpg exporter that will export the frames for you but while i know how to display a single picture how would i go about displaying multiple at a set frame rate,,
123544940524339204,captainchunck,10/02/2020 12:07 AM,Not 21 sory 24,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,10/02/2020 12:12 AM,"So you would have two options
Either directly in an `Update(float timeslice)` or in a `ScriptCallQueue`

I would do in an update. capture the start time
`float start = timeslice;`
then every subsequent update capture the deltaTime
`float dT = timeslice - start;`
now that you have the time since start, you can determine which frame to display
at 24fps you go to the next frame every 41.6666666 ms
so you could do
`int frameNum = Math.Floor(dT / 41.66666) + 1;`
now your frame number will be from 1 to X. Say your video has 1000 frames. Do this
`if(frameNum > 1000) { farmeNum = 1; }`
this way your video will now loop.
Okay so now that we have the frame numbers, you just need to set the image based on that frame number. 
I'd store each video frame like
`???\Some\Path\To\Images\frame_[Num].paa` then you just replace `[Num]` with `frameNum.ToString()` to give you something like
`???\Some\Path\To\Images\frame_2.paa`",,

```modded class ZombieBase extends DayZInfected

    // This override gets called
    override void Init() 
    {
        super.Init();
        Print(""Init..."");

    {
        super.EEHitBy(damageResult, damageType, source, component, dmgZone, ammo, modelPos, speedCoef);
        Print(""Bang"");

Luckily, Enfusion has a ""search solution"" (ctrl+shift+f) option like vscode which you can use to find functions by common name (FindXByX, GetXByX) and where/how they're used. But I think that's the best we have.

As far as configs go, it's not rocket science and if someone needs to have their hand held, perhaps modding in an environment that doesn't have nearly enough documentation isn't for that person. It's not hard to read the vanilla configs to learn.",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,10/16/2020 2:02 AM,Comparing dayz modding to an actual bona fide language that has decades of support and documentation is like comparing apples to oranges,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,10/16/2020 2:05 AM,If you test your stuff in a server and not COM before releasing it you shouldn't need it to be reported to you,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,10/16/2020 2:06 AM,Ok guess there are no missing textures in vanilla now,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,10/16/2020 2:09 AM,"Modding shouldn’t be find it out all by yourself, BI’s tools aren’t the greatest at letting their users know what’s wrong. Just because you were here the day modding support dropped and learned everything yourself, doesn’t mean it needs to be the same pain staking process for everyone involved. People make mistakes, it’s the whole reason for machine validation and correction. Why use a calculator if you can do every equation on paper or in your head. It’s not hand holding, if you think that, then that’s boomer logic to not accept change because you went the hard route.

If I understand the basics of how RV configs worked then cool, but I’m going to make a mistake every now and then, and I don’t want to spend countless of wasted time on finding an issue when the machine can tell me what’s wrong in a seconds worth of time",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,10/16/2020 2:09 AM,Yeah that's because addon breaker doesn't report such errors which is why Bohemia doesn't know about them which is why pboproject is better,,
