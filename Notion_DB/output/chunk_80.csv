135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/07/2021 3:59 PM,that would stop code getting executed on other clients in the network bubble if you had something synced,,

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,03/07/2021 4:00 PM,right,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,03/07/2021 4:00 PM,so here is what I am trying now,,
241680063072960513,kuli_vt,03/07/2021 4:01 PM,UpdateCameraNV is the next level of code when the actual player is know,,

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,03/07/2021 4:06 PM,any suggestions?  there is so much in there,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/07/2021 4:06 PM,these are essentially shaders,,

241680063072960513,kuli_vt,03/07/2021 4:06 PM,but I just wanted a simple pair of sunglasses...EV was so so nice,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/07/2021 10:22 PM,you line it up in the OB from center point.. make sure your geo lod has the property ```autocenter = 0``` make sure you model is in the center of OB.. then test.. if its not lined up.. then move it in OB.. until it does.. but autocenter is what will place the center of the model into the center of the proxie it is attaching to.,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/07/2021 10:23 PM,you can create a proxie in your model anywehre and point it to the item you want to see inside of Bulldozer as well..,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/07/2021 10:24 PM,some of this would best be asked in #modelling-dayz too lol there is no way in script to move the pos of an attachment when connecting to a proxie..,,

224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:46 AM,does it make a real difference other than allowing me to search for snippets across all the scripts?,,
224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:47 AM,"or is it actually allowing access to more data, being decompiled",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 10:47 AM,What you need to do right now is look through the actual game configs (config.cpp files) to see how the items are configured.,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 10:47 AM,There you will find how things like name and description are set,,
224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:49 AM,ok I'll start there. is there a guide for how to make a mod that does something like this that you know of?,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 10:52 AM,This is Arma modding essentially. Which there's a ton of documentation for. You can probably Google your config questions.,,
224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:52 AM,ok thanks i'll do some research,,
224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:53 AM,Do you have the decompiled 1.11 bookmarked?,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 10:54 AM,Mount your P drive and use DayZ tools to decompile the game into it,,
224468970416111617,aarongrantson,03/08/2021 10:55 AM,"I don't have a P drive. I seem to be missing some of the basics about modding or server creation, maybe I skimmed a wiki link on this discord or something",,

251487757640138753,athosbenther,03/08/2021 11:07 AM,No. I just set up the Template folder and was trying to open it,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 11:14 AM,I'd put AB_AN-PEQ in the ModTemplate folder so it gets its own pbo,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 11:15 AM,Or better. Make a folder called gear and put it in there,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 11:15 AM,I recommend using vscode to find and replace every instance of ModTemplate with your prefix name.,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/08/2021 11:16 AM,Then change the two folder names. Run SetupWorkdrive,,

I have been writing an AI mod for DayZ, and have gotten pretty far. However, when my bots fire their weapons, no server side ballistics calculations are done & no damage is dealt. Does anyone know what code must get executed server side to do these calculations?

I have tried using `Weapon::TryFire()` and `Weapon::Fire()` to no avail - also have tried getting stack traces and debug statements everywhere to understand it, but I still don't see what I am missing.

I am trying to make a workaround with `DayZPhysics.RayCastBullet()` and `Man::ProcessDirectDamage()` but as you can imagine it is a mess. I would rather not handle all of these ballistic calculations myself if I can use the builtin ones.",,"üëç (2),succ (1)"
