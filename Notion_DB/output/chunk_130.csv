But the `OnStoreLoad()` of the bl_stove_barrel is pretty standard:

        super.OnStoreLoad( ctx, version );
        if ( !super.OnStoreLoad( ctx, version ) )

anything that is part of the world is visable to all players.

you could try to edit the model of the box in a way, that it is only visible at the highest LOD and is empty at lower LOD's, it will pop in when the player gets close enough... but you probably wont be able to sync it with the entering the building perfectly... but the first LOD change is pretty fast. i have noticed it with a magazine i did once. i had bullets in the mag at LOD 0.0 and deleted them in LOD 1.0 .... only a couple steps aways the bullets disappeared",,

i have a weapon crate which has a open and close sound for the lid. but when the object is spawned in it plays this sound.
normaly thats not a problem since the object is loaded way before you are in hearing range, but when the crate is inside of a burried stash, and you get into the distance the stash is loaded, the crate in the stash plays the sound and gives away the location of the stash... i had to turn of the sound as a hotfix",,

I have 
```
override void EEHitBy(TotalDamageResult damageResult, int damageType, EntityAI source, int component, string dmgZone, string ammo, vector modelPos, float speedCoef)
{     
    // T1 Raid
    if ( ammo == ""Rocket_Remnants_PG7VL"" ) //if the defined variable from above equals the string exactly..

      }
    }
};
```

in a script overriding BBP_Bwall.

The issue I have for the part above is that it is meant to be for T1 raiding, but I can raid T2 walls also with this rocket type, as T2 walls are built on the base of T1 stuff ``t1_wall_planks`` & ``t1_wall_logs_horizontal``. 
The things to look for T2 are named ``t2_metal`` & ``t2_metal_2``. 

How would I extend this part above for this ammo type to not destroy walls, if they have ``t1_wall_planks`` & ``t1_wall_logs_horizontal``  as base.

Thanks in advance, kinda stuck there.",,

Sneaky Kitty has  some good scripting info. <https://www.youtube.com/c/SneakyKittyGameDev/search>.

387175266113421312,imex6k,09/24/2022 12:58 PM,yeah thanks for you advise; when i look on source code it seems like i have to get the widget from m_WidgetRoot. And therefore i would need to get the m_WidgetRoot from expansion if i dont want to create the layout completely new. is this possible? i cant tell üòÑ,,
328461966232256513,varyel,09/24/2022 1:55 PM,"@iMex never used expansion so i dunno how it works, but surely is linked to an image/.layout, try to investigate on that direction and simply change the path of the image",,

328461966232256513,varyel,09/24/2022 2:20 PM,mmm for editing widget you have to repack or you can make a mod override changing the name of the widget/layout( but keeping the same value except for the image path),,

328461966232256513,varyel,09/24/2022 2:43 PM,well if you made an override changing the color and substitute the widget layout path with that ( should be in the constructor or close to it ) not experienced with layout so i can t be more useful =.=,,

But I see that you instantiate `fillet_map` outside of the constructor. You then throw away that instance and assign `fillet_map` to the instance returned by your getter. I assume that the getter returns an instance of `fillet_map` that was created in `filereader`.  It makes me wonder if you are missing a ref in the definition of `fillet_map` in `filereader`? If you added a static ref in `prepareasianbass` I don't think it did you any good.,,

600793545594634241,kpro1982,09/27/2022 8:14 AM,Got it. Although even in the refactored code you need to make sure that the object that you create __inside__ filereader doesn't run out of scope.  I'll add one other thing although its probably not related at all. Its sometimes possible to create configs on the server and also on the client and then confuse them in code. I've had a mysterious data going missing issue that came down to that. Probably not the situation here though. https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/492295576470290433/1012893065180090378 Good luck üôÇ,,

Whats wrong with this concept?
```CallBack callBack = new CallBack( DoSomething , new Param2<int,string>( 1 , ""two"" ) );

callBack.DoCallback();

class CallBack
{
    private func  m_callBack;
    private Param m_params;
    
    void CallBack( func callBack , Param params = NULL )

    }
}

void DoSomething( Param params = NULL )
{
    ...
}```
Afaik it has nothing to do with the params. If i use `Call() `directly it works. but when wrapped in a class it crashes. So this works:
```GetGame().GetCallQueue( CALL_CATEGORY_SYSTEM ).Call( DoSomething , new Param2<int,string>( 1 , ""two"" ) ); // this works```",,

272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:03 PM,And it will work,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:03 PM,and remove the bad refs,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 7:03 PM,will try this too. didn't think of declaring the variable to be managed. i only declared the class as managed (class myclass : managed). but i think due to the refs i fcked it up.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:04 PM,ref should only be used with Managed,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:04 PM,doing ref Class actually causes it to go invalid if that is the only ref for your object,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:07 PM,Classes that are anywhere starting form the Game module and up automatically inherit from Managed so no need to do `class MyClass : Managed` in your case,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 7:10 PM,"i always struggle when to use managed, autoptr, ref ... where i'm from i never even needed to be aware of var types üòÑ",,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:10 PM,"I know that Managed inherits from Class, and it could make sense for you to be able to do `ref Class` then but that's not the case",,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:10 PM,It will misbehave in that case,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:11 PM,"If you want to allow for ""All class types"" in a variable or some container and you want to use ref without issues then you have to do `ref Managed`",,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:11 PM,Don't ask me why it works like that as I do not know,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:11 PM,I only know it works that way üòÖ,,ü§™ (1)
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:12 PM,The biki article does not do a good job explaining it as well,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:13 PM,I will write a proper article for DayZ and Reforger,,üëç (1)
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:13 PM,Hopefully it clears a lot of stuff,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 7:16 PM,lmk if it fixed your issue,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 7:30 PM,tried your suggestion with my example code. still not working. ```Undefined function 'Managed.DoSomething'```,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 7:31 PM,but if i use `Print(MyClass1.m_myClass2)` it doesnt say `INVALID` anymore.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 8:13 PM,You tried to call that method without casting it to the proper type,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:14 PM,castig the method? ü§î,,
561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:14 PM,or the class?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 8:15 PM,The instance you wanted to call the method from,,

561321458635112492,Cho Buggers#9338,09/29/2022 8:17 PM,"but then the whole idea seems pointless to me since i dont know what class the user will pass. so i still would need to provide a callback class the user can inherit its own callback from, right?",,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/29/2022 8:17 PM,Mmm,,
