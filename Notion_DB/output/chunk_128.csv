239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/25/2022 3:30 AM,yup callLater progressively gets slower over time until it stops working all together. I assume its getting flooded due to use with other mods. Not cleaning up things out of call queue when they are complete and other bad practices,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/25/2022 3:34 AM,Also you can break every mod that uses the timer by doing `GetCallQueue(..catagory..).Clear();`,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/25/2022 3:53 AM,yea. The only thing preventing release really is the fact it mods OnStore for every ItemBase… and the list of symptoms is a tad shorter than I’d Like for initial release. and if revamping the symptom system makes it easier to implement future symptoms I’m all about it. make it a co-project.,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,08/25/2022 3:56 AM,It means `GetKeyCard()` has parameters and you're not including any in your call to it. Can't really help you any further without seeing `GetKeyCard()` method.,,👍 (1)
185896664110727168,osodirty,08/25/2022 4:17 AM,"It really simple to add them.```c
class Any_Custom_Symptom: SymptomBase
{
    override void OnInit()
    {
        m_SymptomType = SymptomTypes.SECONDARY;
        m_Priority = 0;
        m_ID = Custom_SymptomID.CUSTOM_SYMPTOM //Make enum for this value
        m_DestroyOnAnimFinish = false;
        m_IsPersistent = false;
        m_SyncToClient = true;
        m_IsClientOnly = true;

    override void OnGetDeactivatedClient(PlayerBase player)
    {    
        //stop doing stuff

Then just register similar to actions/recipes, and give it an enum. 

Call or stop it in modifier (which is setup similarly but keeps track of more stuff) with 
`player.GetSymptomManager().QueueUpSecondarySymptom(Custom_SymptomID.CUSTOM_SYMPTOM);`
and
`player.GetSymptomManager().RemoveSecondarySymptom(Custom_SymptomID.CUSTOM_SYMPTOM);`",,

I've created a customized main menu and I'm facing the following situation:
- when the player is connecting on my server using the DZSA Launcher;
- and it selects the ""Load"" option from the launcher, not the ""Play""
- it opens the dayz and stops on my main menu. But when the player hits the ""Play"" button, it tries to connect to my server using the mods from the players previous played server, so there are more/less/different mods

Any ideas on how to solve this?

The part of the code from the OnClick method is below:
```
    override bool OnClick( Widget w, int x, int y, int button )
    {
        if( button == MouseState.LEFT )

                Play();

I wanted to read some simple config values from a json. Zedmag very generously pointed me to the code that he uses in his flyingbirds mod. I adapted it correctly to read a single integer value. Not surprisingly given that Zedmag's code was production, the adapted code worked perfectly. However, when I subsequently tried to add values to the .json, the script would not read them. It was very frustrating even though I received lots of good help and advice. As it turns out the problem was in these two lines of  Zedmag's code as I had adapted it:
```private static const string configPath = ""$profile:\\RationalBases\\FB_Settings.json"";
private static const string configRoot = ""$profile:\\RationalBases\\"";    ```
The problem wasn't with the code itself but that I used it without really understanding it. I wasn't paying attention to whether my code was running on the server or the client. Data saves in different locations depending on where its run. `.\serverprofile` folder for the server and  `.\appdata\local\dayz` folder for the client. The problem was that I was changing the values `.\serverprofile`. Once I cleared this up, the code works as expected and I can add new config settings to my hearts content. 🙂 The tl;dr is make sure that you *understand* the code that you crib from someone else. I still don't understand how/why these two folders are semi-linked. Maybe a more experienced coder here can shed light on that.",,

With a small config, I want to let the server owner decide for himself whether he wants to enable the players to craft the furniture or rather only in the form of prefab kits.
In Actions like disassembling it is easy to determine what Kit the process returns. But it seems like it's not that easy to  disable the crafting of kits.

Currently i try to prevent the registration of the recipes:

```modded class PluginRecipesManagerBase
{
    override void RegisterRecipies()
    {
        super.RegisterRecipies();

        if ( GetBLPalletConfig().UseCrafting )

            RegisterRecipe(new bl_CraftKitTable);
        }
    }
}```

This doesn't work. The recipes are always registered.

So I decided to deny crafting a kit via ""CanDo"" within the recipe... but this doesn't work either.
As if ""CanDo"" is only executed at the end of the crafting process - which actually would be ""Do"".
The recipe is available and I can also craft, it's just that nothing is created in the end and no ingredients are consumed.",,

I am now of the opinion that I need to script a new item that will auto-spawn with the kit but not sure the best way to go about this, I assume there is a script command that overrides a method for spawning but can't find it.

`Usage of ref keyword
In the Enforce script by default all variables are weak references, ref keyword is marking that variable is strong reference. In some special cases, variables are strong references by default

local variables inside functions
function arguments
function return value
and are released after their scope ends.

While an object is stored in at least one strong reference, it's being kept alive. When the last strong reference is destroyed or overwritten, the object is destroyed and all other (only weak refs left) references are set to NULL. When an object is deleted manually by delete command (e.g., 'delete a;'), it is deleted immediately ignoring reference count, and all references (weak and strong) are set to NULL.`",,

Normally, the compiler will release the memory (i.e. delete the object) when the scope ends.  The `ref keyword` tells the compiler to hold on to it until that specific reference is deleted.  The result is that memory may be accessible to you in other parts of your code, which could be useful.  But it also means that it can hang around way longer than you need it to choking the resources of the server. I think the rule of thumb around here (others can chime in if I'm wrong here) is to limit the usage of ref until you really need it.  If you search on this discord you'll see some advice like that.",,

I'm not very experienced on scripting, just trying to start and create some things
One of the things I would like to do is:
I have a piece of code that runs on the DayZ Client side (custom menu) and would like to get some parameter information that is on the servers (ie: the server IP and port) so I could just change by a config if the server IP changes...
anyone could give me a small help? where I could start looking into to learn? if there is any mod that has something like that I could look into!!!
Thanks",,

I do it like in this Example:
```override vector GetDefaultOrientation()
    {
        YourKitClass your_Kit = YourKitClass.Cast( m_Parent );
    
        if ( your_Kit )
        {
            return super.GetDefaultOrientation() + your_Kit.Get_PlacingOri(); //Get_PlacingOri() will return a vector.
        }

        return super.GetDefaultOrientation();
    }```

And then Add this to my Kits:

```vector Get_PlacingOri()
    {        
        return ""180 0 0"";
    }```",,❤️ (1)

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,09/04/2022 8:43 PM,I never said there is a null pointer in your script. But in this script shown it is not checked if the item created even was created. GetGame().CreateObject returns the reference to the object created. If it didnt it returns null. @ZARGE was unsure if a item even was created or not. Checking the return value would have been an easy thing to figure if thats true or not,,
640851831446306816,ZARGE#3605,09/04/2022 8:45 PM,Yea I double checked. I got the coords twice even. Buddy even tried spawning a stack of wooden planka and it didnt show,,
640851831446306816,ZARGE#3605,09/04/2022 8:46 PM,"Yea thats what that print is for, I just wanted to check if it recognized it",,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,09/04/2022 8:47 PM,do it like i showed,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,09/04/2022 8:48 PM,"its says.. (if server and time) OR (if time) thats why client it is showing it.. it needs to be ```if server
