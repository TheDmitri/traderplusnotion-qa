356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/13/2019 1:57 PM,@novadose keep in mind that if the print function is executed on the client it writes into the clients log files and not into the server log files,,
537328585388851200,novadose,09/13/2019 3:04 PM,I'll check it out @Dr_J0nes thanks for the tip.  Since scripted lights are client side thats highly likely what is happening here,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/13/2019 3:33 PM,Just Checkout appdata/local/DayZ/ or something similar :D can't remember the exact path,,

so just use == for year,month,day,hour and minute, and eval the rising edge of the condition with a static SchedulerTaskDone bool...

GetHealth(); cannot be called on client. 

is there an other way to get the healthpoints of an item to check if the ""actioncondition"" can be true?

i want a item ""triggerable"" only when it has a lower HP than its max health. And no, `GameConstants.STATE_DAMAGED` or kinda of these are not usefull for me. Somebody an idea? I tried to send RPC´s, turned out there were useless in this case. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Or maybe im wrong. Any help is highly apreciated",,

Is more delicate access to the damagesystem planned?",,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 12:56 AM,I must tinker,,
100686705241112576,sanguine00,09/22/2019 12:56 AM,i'm curious about that 51 number in your first capture.  not aware of a 3x multiplier for head shots.  but maybe that's new,,

100686705241112576,sanguine00,09/22/2019 12:56 AM,oh 😄,,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,I removed the RNG damages like brain,,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,and just increased the base mult a little,,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,So combat would be more consistant,,
100686705241112576,sanguine00,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,are you messing with damage fall-off at all?,,
100686705241112576,sanguine00,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,or can we even do that,,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 12:57 AM,That's bullet based,,

180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 1:01 AM,Not much can be done apparently,,
180757017432948736,tennesseetimmy,09/22/2019 1:02 AM,At least to the damage system,,
100686705241112576,sanguine00,09/22/2019 1:03 AM,"one thing i discovered in 1.04, is that melee axe hits to the head can arbitrarily register as ""brain"" shots.  and when it does, it registers 0 damage. 😄  unlike projectiles, melee appears to only be able to hit one zone",,
251796151760715777,remoz_,09/22/2019 1:03 AM,"Hello! 🙂 Little question:
I read a JSON, elaborate items contained in it, then change status of elaborated items and save updated JSON... if during elaboration i need to remove items (to avoid they will be elaborated more than one time) from an array contained in a complex object nested in the JSON, but want to keep the complete original array for when i write JSON at the end, how can i do it? 

```autoptr ref TStringArray subItemList = so.GetItemsList();```

Cause i must use ""ref"" when ""Get"" the itemList from the main JSON object, but don't want to modify this! I've tried to make a ""copy"" into another array just after ""Get"" from object, and remove items from this last one, but at the end i have emptied the array on original object too... it's possible to make a copy of a ""ref"" array that is unlinked from the original array? Or something similar...?

Thanks in advance!",,
