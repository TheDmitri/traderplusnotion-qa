Trying to make a ""puzzle"", where I would use a UI, showing a set of 4 single-digit numbers for 5 seconds, and then allowing the user to enter 4 letters after. These would be verified using a database (or something more simple?), where if correct it would unlock a door. If wrong, the user has an additional 2 attempts, before they fail.

The UI would be ""similar"" to red/black codelock UI, but would also have a timer counting down, and a ""number of tries"" listed, along with being able to only enter letters in.

Does anyone have any idea how I can even start to make this, or any resources I should look at for this?

and every day the ideas for it get more complex....

hada thought today about instead of being able to attach the arms yourself, your either have to get someone else to put them on or i make a robo dr npc type thing with a action to attach them to you... but just thinking about that is making my brain melt.

Thanks once again to you and zed for all your help with this cyborg arm project. 

im sure i will be calling upon both your skills again soon.
next is the upgrade actions... if player has one arm on, they can hold the other in there hand and upgrade to the pair...

still thinking that one through.

708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:31 AM,he saves it as GUID,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:31 AM,There's gotta be some way to get a name from the GUID,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:31 AM,`ClientData.m_PlayerList.m_PlayerList`,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:32 AM,Not sure what you mean? I call his variable m_TerritoryOwner which is where each flags GUID is stored,,

708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:32 AM,I've never used that so to be completely honest not sure how to implement it in any way shape or form,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:33 AM,unless you want to loop through every player and check for an ID,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:34 AM,So there's no work around method for the fake method of m_TerritoryOwner.GetFullName() or whatever,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:34 AM,but you should look into how basic territories interacts with game labs,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:34 AM,Already did,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:35 AM,"It grabs the player's GetId() aka GUID when they claim the territory. Then store that in OnStoreSave, etc. Then within it's GameLabs interaction it just makes a new _Event and within that custom event string they just stick in m_TerritoryOwner which is why the picture above just shows their GUID",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:36 AM,the reason why using name wouldn't really work is because the player would have to be online,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:37 AM,you could store steam id along with it and use a webapi to get the player's steam name,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:38 AM,i think you can even have links in gamelabs html markdown,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:38 AM,so no webapi and just store the steam id along side,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:38 AM,then override the GameLabsUpdate method,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:39 AM,Now I'm just lost. Thanks for trying tho. I never messed with their html markdown stuff nor do I understand much of HTML tho it may be simple never had a need to mess with it. Sorry brother. I wanted their name as even if they aren't online it should be able to pull their last known name. Then I can easily search that name in CF Tools and it WILL find them. Easier then searching up that long UID string.,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:41 AM,"I used to do it in my car ownership mod where I saved their name, but then again I called GetName() or whatever not needing to convert GUID to name so",,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:42 AM,+ if I store their SteamID with it it won't store the steam ID of all previously placed flags only count towards newer ones so it wouldn't help much,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/04/2022 8:43 AM,So you‚Äôre trying to get the name from past saves?,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:43 AM,yes,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:43 AM,without the need of them being online,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/04/2022 8:43 AM,not gonna happen.,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:44 AM,could always use RestAPI along with CFCloud's API,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,03/04/2022 8:44 AM,So the only way I can get names is if he store GetName to start off with instead of just GUID,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/04/2022 8:45 AM,or both. But yes. Otherwise you‚Äôre doing a back track. Using the Guid yo try and get the steam ID then using whatever nickname comes along with it.,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/04/2022 8:45 AM,"BUT going forward like War said, you could just store it along with it.",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:46 AM,wouldn't be difficult to backtrack names for placed territories either,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/04/2022 8:48 AM,but the best bet is to probably just use cftools cloud api,,

Handles both scenarios.",,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,03/07/2022 10:14 PM,"thanks for the reply
can `item.IsKindOf(""SmallStone"")` be a base class of an item",,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,03/07/2022 10:15 PM,"so like this 
`item.IsKindOf(""Clothing"")`
`return false;`",,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/07/2022 10:22 PM,"For that type of check do item.IsInherited(Clothing) [note the lack of quotes, this is type check)",,

return item.IsInherited(Clothing);",,

- If returns true, will allow the item to be loaded into the containers cargo
- If returns false, will not allow the item to be loaded

Assuming you put that in your clothing item, yeah",,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/07/2022 10:27 PM,You can remove the other line at the top though. no need for 2 item.IsInherited,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/07/2022 10:28 PM,IsInherited returns a boolean so w/e that is will decide if the item can be put into cargo,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/07/2022 10:42 PM,Otherwise it‚Äôll drop all cargo on the ground when loading back in after logging in or upon server restart,,
