483945142424698881,nines9805,10/29/2018 12:12 AM,just play about lowering the cost from 100 liek `100 down to 99` then `100 down to 98 ` then maybe go further and do `100 down to 75 `,,
483945142424698881,nines9805,10/29/2018 12:13 AM,with only the items you want to spawn the most,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:04 AM,@DaOne(Mark) have you tried recalculating CE loot positions for deleted buildings? like does it make it so loot doesnt spawn in the air for them?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:04 AM,or does it only work for newly added buildings,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:04 AM,what sort of buildings? the once placed by the map or custom one,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,10/29/2018 4:05 AM,the ones in the map,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:05 AM,delete existing buildings,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:05 AM,i havent used it yet. does the .xml file it outputs contain all the loot positions for every single building on the map that it detects?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:06 AM,so that would mean deleting a building would result in no definition for it in the .xml?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:06 AM,what you can do (i have not tested) is make a server side script that will delete the building by getting it from crosshair pos. So make a client mod (onkeypress DELETE do delete building RPC) delete the building on both sides. n from there tell the server to generate a new map group pos. and it will not pickup,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:06 AM,maybe,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:06 AM,yes any building that it detects,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:06 AM,im asking about the last bit,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,"i have not try it, now i want to LOL",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,i guess they way it works is it checks HouseNoMemes class,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,then get MLOD for proxy loot pos,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,yea neat if that works. then i'll just go ahead and implement deleting and moving exist map objects,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,for com,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,"if == it there, then make xml for this tits",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:07 AM,mhm,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:08 AM,that would be lit. But how would you use it on server? cant remove map edits,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:08 AM,cant u delete objects on the server,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:08 AM,?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:08 AM,"you can, but if its map object, like placed via PBO. it will only delete on server",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:08 AM,== client can see it but has no collide with it,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:09 AM,placed via pbo?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:09 AM,so you would need an RPC to do delete on both heads,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:09 AM,"yea like an actual map object, not via script EntityAI objj",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:09 AM,oh no i dont mean map objects,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:09 AM,oh k. It should work 10/10,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/29/2018 4:10 AM,since u cant even spawn them anyway,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:20 AM,Does anyone know what’s a good radius that will cover the whole map?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:21 AM,"15,000m?",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,10/29/2018 4:21 AM,"No harm in going too big, right?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/29/2018 4:34 AM,yea it would take longer to generate thats about it,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,10/29/2018 5:28 AM,is there really not a way to remove the limit or set a new limit to the amount of loot that can spawn,,
