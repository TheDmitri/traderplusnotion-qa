Is overriding a function from another mod as easy as just inheriting from it and then overriding the desired function? I was feeling confident it was going to work as I was getting a couple compiling errors which I have now fixed (so I know the file is getting read atleast). However I am still not getting the expected result",,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 9:20 PM,might be worth testing your webhook in isolation first to make sure the code is clean then call that already tested and working function from your overriding function?,,

I am getting a can't find variable error on 'var' - a variable that is created and set in the super execution and that I then want to use in my script. Am I missing something obvious?",,

245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:33 PM,do I need to define it empty before super?,,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:33 PM,then let super do it's thing then take it on after?,,
284442265596854272,i_am_lupine,04/04/2023 10:34 PM,"If your passing it into the super, then yes",,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:34 PM,"well no, it doesn't work quite like that",,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:34 PM,basically modded function recieves some args,,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:34 PM,passes the args to super,,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:35 PM,"then, inside super (so the original execution), new variables are created",,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:35 PM,which I want to use after calling super,,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:35 PM,make sense?,,
284442265596854272,i_am_lupine,04/04/2023 10:36 PM,If the variable you are accessing is created as a result of the super function call. I believe it would out of scope and therefore inaccessible (I am new to enforce script so someone correct me if I am wrong),,
245265732978475009,kharn_thebetrayer,04/04/2023 10:37 PM,Oh that's a pain. So I would almost need to repeat the logic inside the super and create/calc the variables myself,,

I'm working on a deathmatch vanilla server. I picked up from an existing script and I'm trying to refactor / improve it.
We use the init.c to set kits and spawn items for the players.

At the moment we have a long list of kit, themselve composed as several properties of the class `customMission`. Those are strings and TStringArray.
Example : 
```c
class CustomMission : MissionServer {

  autoptr TStringArray Assault_Clothing = {""BallisticHelmet_Black"", ""USMCJacket_Desert"", ""USMCPants_Desert"", ""PoliceVest""};
  string Assault_Gun = ""M4A1"";
  string Assault_SideArm = ""MakarovIJ70"";
  autoptr TStringArray Assault_SideArm_Attachments = {""MakarovPBSuppressor""};
  autoptr TStringArray Assault_Attachments = {""M4_CQBBttstck_Black"", ""ACOGOptic_6x"", ""M4_RISHndgrd_Black""};
  autoptr TStringArray Assault_Mags = {""MAG_STANAG_30Rnd"", ""MAG_IJ70_8RND""}

}
```

Later one, we have in the `StartingEquipSetup` override a stupidly long `switch`.
This `switch` uses a random number with hardcoded min and max values.
Each `case` of this `switch` repeat the same exact functions/methods to equip the players depending on the variables I described above.

I would like to do several things:
- Have an array containing those kits, so I can just random on the count and have function written only once
- Have a class to represent a kit that I would put into this array

I'm very new to ENscripts and I'm kinda lost on how it works, what can be done and what can't (last time my kits were null when I returned the array from a buildKits functions for exemple)",,

Keep in mind I'm working on a vanilla server init.c, I'm not trying to build a ""real"" mod

I'm very new to enscript and certainly have a lot to learn. 
You guessed well, I'm mainly a PHP dev. I asked about PascalCase earlier on this channel and didn't get any answer I've started with php standards. Should I switch to PascalCase ? 

Regarding the structure, I'm on a first pass to remove a stupid long code duplicating switch / case
If I can then improve that in some ways I'd love to. I thought about having a json file for each kit and loading them in the init.c to get rid of that big list of kit
I'd love to talk about the topic if you find the time to do so

I would like to have a member property of a type that would look like an associative array, if possible that I could declare on the fly (like an array)

185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/08/2023 1:54 AM,To go more into detail on this - originally enforce was made with optional semicolons (similar to languages like kotlin) over time bi has added more and more to the language. At a certain point a language becomes too ambiguous to not contain any semicolons without some drawbacks. As a work around ';' is its own statement. Thinking of semicolons as optional will lead to problems (they are only optional in certain cases). For things like unbraced if/else (class and methods can be unbraced too but this is terrible convention) the semicolon statement tells the parser when it ends.,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/08/2023 1:55 AM,This is why a single script with 200 semicolons can get compiled perfectly,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,04/08/2023 1:56 AM,"Also why the following is weird to read..

if (a == b) return true; { return false; };",,‚òùÔ∏è (1)
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/08/2023 1:58 AM,Also with this in mind its also a good point that '{ statements* }' is also a single statement.,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/08/2023 2:16 AM,Which is why `int test() return true` works,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,04/10/2023 1:36 AM,"you pretty much have to know enforce script to have chatgpt write something for you, cannot express how much you have to correct or tell it that it's doing something completely wrong",,
185896664110727168,osodirty,04/10/2023 1:38 AM,"Yea, I need to find a cleaner way to swap to the open model of my strongroom. I'm spawning it 1000m up, then orienting it, matching open doors, then placing it over the other and deleting the original. There's a small handful of servers that it's causing to crash. I released an override that reverted it back to not swapping models, and it fixed it for them. I have tried to replicate the crash 200+ times and simply can't.",,
