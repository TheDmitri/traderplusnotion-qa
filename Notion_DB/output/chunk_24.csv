239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:04 AM,It‚Äôs BI,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:05 AM,try casting it to an Object,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:05 AM,And not Building class,,
314695485405396995,thenswan.eth,02/18/2019 8:07 AM,"wyd I do this? : )
my goal is to bind to exact building some data, and when server restarts -> building get new persistent ids so this connection between my data and that building is lost forever
Im thinking use coordinates, its the only workaround that on my mind now",,

maybe somehow ask it from BI devs ? submit report of this one so they will know its not working properly?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:13 AM,Actually,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:14 AM,You can‚Äôt do it with buildings,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:14 AM,Because they don‚Äôt save via db,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:14 AM,Buildings placed by script can be by adding them to the types.xml,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:14 AM,But those that are placed via map data cant be saved,,
314695485405396995,thenswan.eth,02/18/2019 8:15 AM,So I can't do it with persistence and need to do it with coordinates?,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:16 AM,Pretty sure all buildings have OnStoreLoad and unload,,
314695485405396995,thenswan.eth,02/18/2019 8:16 AM,I decided to save it using building persistent ID (to identify building) and doorIndex,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:17 AM,Variable data save,,
314695485405396995,thenswan.eth,02/18/2019 8:17 AM,And what to do with it if this building IDs contently change on server restart?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:17 AM,You would not need building ID,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/18/2019 8:18 AM,the data gets saved and attached to that entity,,

So I want to add in a bit of code that will randomly (rarely though) spawn in a pack of wolves in a few locations. Would I add that in tools.c?",,
