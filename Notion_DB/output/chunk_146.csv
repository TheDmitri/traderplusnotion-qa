I have a question that might be complicated..not even sure if I'm doing it right since I'm very new to dayz modding. 
I'm trying to load a JSON file from a script file (script file is inside a pbo mod folder). 
I added the JSON file in the root server folder (DayZServer) folder. 
I checked if the file exists from within the script and it returns true which is good. 
Now when I try to parse/load the json file, I can't get it to work, I'm using this method to load it: data.LoadFromFile(""loot.json"") //data extends JsonApiStruct class. 
What is it that I'm doing wrong ?",,
220980493276020736,.gramps.,03/15/2023 4:18 PM,would I need to use an RPC to make sure something executes on the client before the server?,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/15/2023 4:50 PM,You are on the right track gramps,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/15/2023 4:51 PM,"Most likely they are not delineating between reading the file on the server, then sending the config to clients.",,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/15/2023 4:52 PM,"It usually goes,
Server starts
Server reads config
Client initiates connection event
Server sends rpc to client with most recent config object",,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/15/2023 4:52 PM,Client now has access to the json config in a read only capacity as changes are not synched to the server unless the client issues an rpc to the server,,

something like this might be up your alley in terms of checking when a player disconnects and is in the driver seat of a vehicle
```cs
modded class PlayerBase
{
    override void OnDisconnect()
    {
        CarScript car;
        HumanCommandVehicle hcv = GetCommand_Vehicle(); // get vehicle command from player

        // check if vehicle command is active and get current transport
        if (hcv && CarScript.CastTo(car, hcv.GetTransport()))
        {
            // check if disconnecting player is in the driver seat
            if (hcv.GetVehicleSeat() == DayZPlayerConstants.VEHICLESEAT_DRIVER)
            {
                // do something with car
                Print(car);

I thought that ``type = ""Melee"";`` might be the one I can change.
As those types are also the one in ``class globalarmor``.

basically replace ``melee`` with ``rpg`` in my bullet selection and then add a section in config entry for the item to be like this.

```
class GlobalArmor
{
        class RPG
    {
        class Health
        {
            damage = 1;
        };
        class Blood
        {
            damage = 0;
        };
        class Shock
        {
            damage = 0;
        };
    };
};

189097125521522699,thejeremy,03/21/2023 10:03 PM,"So item configs like the plate vest have the entry ``class DamageSystem``
In there hitpoints are defined and much more.

In ``class DamageSystem`` there is ``class GlobalArmor``

For ``GlobalArmor`` you have different classes like ``projectile, melee, infected or FragGrenade``

They basically are a multiplier for how much damage for Health, blood and shock is been dealt to the item.

I would want another class, such as  ``projectile, melee, infected or FragGrenade`` which will be linked to work with my rpg explosion.

So I can set the multiplier for all above named classes to 0 to not get any damage by those and only get damage from my RPG.

It would be way easier to show via stream. lol

I dont wanna spam the channel with configs.",,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/22/2023 6:05 PM,"ANY edit to the game files requires a pbo. (barring config and some other things, but for the purpose of your question)

IF you want your pbo to be usable by anyone other than yourself, you will need to make your own PBO

When learning how to make your first PBO, follow Spurgle's guide to get started.",,üëç (1)

275328660242694144,xeonmeister,03/22/2023 6:06 PM,I have a 'protected static string' thats called 'LOOP_SOUND' and is declared in my class. When i make a class that extends this class and i add 'protected static string LOOP_SOUND' i get that i have multiple declarations. But also if i just do a simple 'LOOP_SOUND = new val' then i get unexpected statement bc somehow enforce doesnt remember i declared that variable in the superclass. Is there a way to overwrite a variable in a subclass?,,
