181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 5:11 PM,item swapping is as far as i am concerned not a single process. what happens is it gets detached and another entitiy is attached,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 5:15 PM,The only swapping is via Inventory which has as canswap function,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/29/2020 5:16 PM,yeah thats why i provided the feedback to see if they could add the can swap attachment option?,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/29/2020 5:16 PM,it would be nice 🥺  but if its just me who wants ill have to figure out a work around,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 5:20 PM,Swapping will always be first a detach then another attach. in terms of scripting api everything you would need is already available. this is why i removed your suggestion. I would not call it a workaround. Have a look at all the events being fired for when you swap attachments. there are multiple layers at which the action should trigger and would be interceptable. If you find something that can not be done with existing ways then suggest something to fill the gap 🙂,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 5:21 PM,you can also catch the item swap way before the actualy swapping happens on the interaction layer on the gui,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 5:21 PM,it will be different from dragging another item on top vs dropping it somewhere else to remove,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/29/2020 5:26 PM,"Yes, but the canswap wouldn't handle the actual swapping only whether or not the action can continue it pretty must just blocks the action, so no real changing of that, its only asking for an extra condition check or a condition check in place of its current conditions just the same way that the canattach and canrelease doesn't handle the actually attaching just weather or not the player is allowed to do the action, which is handled client side as i have made the mistake before with the can attach and if not checked on the client it still works client side. I Know I can do all the stuff on the side of the actions happening but that gets messy and causes potential for more bugs and exploits which is why I call it a work around cause now I'm looking at undoing or interrupting actions instead of just preventing them from happening.",,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/29/2020 5:29 PM,Again your idea of requiring the player to have to have the item in their inventory to swap and then I can allow the attachment to be released has potential and after some more thought Im excited cause I can make that work for sure (Thanks for that Idea 😘 ). but its still a work around,,

173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 6:50 PM,Is there a way to spawn an item in a way that it's NOT facing north?,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 6:50 PM,I know I can rotate it after spawning,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 6:59 PM,I think depends on the orientation of the model in the source p3d. The default orientation would be 0 0 0 if none of the surface align flags are set while spawning,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:01 PM,0 0 0 is no orientation at all,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:01 PM,oh wait,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:02 PM,"no really, which direction would 0 0 0 be?",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:03 PM,maybe you mean direction,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:05 PM,@DaemonForge i suggest you look into vector math. very exhilarating subject 🙂,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:06 PM,"this is the code that i use to make the camera look at the cursor in the main menu
```
vector mouse_pos = m_Camera.GetPosition() + GetGame().GetPointerDirection() * 4;
vector lookat = vector.Direction(m_FunnyMeme.GetPosition(), mouse_pos);
    
m_FunnyMeme.SetDirection(lookat);
```",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:06 PM,i think for your code to work you need SetDirection not setorientation,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:06 PM,"setorientation uses angles, direction uses unit vectors",,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/29/2020 7:07 PM,"@dab Thanks man I really don't want to look at vector math right now, but Ill try SetDirection, if that works that would be f ing awsome",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:07 PM,lmk 🙂,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:12 PM,Orientation and Direction are just different ways to express the same thing. One is angles one is a vector. Regardless I am unsure what you are trying to achieve but you always have to set the orientation you want in script or rotate the p3d to be rotated by default in the way you want it,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:19 PM,yeah,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:19 PM,ink with CreateObjectEx you can use ECE_PLACEONSURFACE or something,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:20 PM,"@Arkensor I'm pretty new to the subject, but I just think that 0 0 0 as an direction is undefined",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:21 PM,@dab What's CreateObjectEx?,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:21 PM,GetGame().CreateObjectEx(),,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:22 PM,"no, that's ok, spawning itself works fine",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:23 PM,"as an orientation, it's northbound I think",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:25 PM,Yes it's not the most straightforward thing. The default orientation / direction can be all 0. That indicates nothing has been set in this regard. When you attempt to set that the object is hidden unintentionally. But all that should not matter to you.,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:25 PM,oh @dab it has a rotation you mean!,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:26 PM,Rotation is along all axis. There are yaw pitch and roll. Direction is just a vector that faces in the result of all angles applied to the forward vector of the object,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:26 PM,"@Arkensor sorry for insisting, but I want to understand things fully. I think for direction, 0 0 0 is not possible, since that's literally ""no vector"".",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:26 PM,i mean,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:26 PM,you can try it,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:26 PM,It would be much easier to tell you what you need if you explain what you try to achieve,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:27 PM,^,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:27 PM,@dab I can't find any example utilizing the 4th param 🙂,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:27 PM,"""0 0 0"" is a valid vector. Sounds stupid, is stupid but it is",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:28 PM,"ok it's a valid vector, but it has no direction 😉",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:28 PM,which means the direction is reset. so the direction will be world X and Z aligned with model X and Z,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:29 PM,"obj.SetDirection(""0 0 0"") -> no good will become invisible",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:29 PM,😄,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:30 PM,has to do with the transformation matrix. because it is all 0 the object scale will be 0,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:30 PM,and hence you dont see it,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:30 PM,"obj.SetOrientation(""0 0 0""); is valid though, since those are angles and not a vector",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:30 PM,"yeah, 0 0 0 is a transformation matrix that leaves any object identitcal",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:31 PM,"yeah, with orientation it's north",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:31 PM,not sure what you are about with north all the time,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:31 PM,"well, orientation 0 0 0 is pointing north, that's just how it is",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:32 PM,"well north is absolute, to an object there is no north in that sense. we mean the same thing though. the object just is in the default orientation",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:33 PM,and you wanted to ask how to adjust that. and the answer would be object builder,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:33 PM,👍,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:34 PM,"also for the sake of completion. the default direction vector is <0.0, 0.0, 1.0>",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,07/29/2020 7:35 PM,"so aligned with the z axis. you would call it the ""north axis""",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:42 PM,yeah exactly,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:59 PM,not the rotation flag,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:59 PM,the ECE flag,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 7:59 PM,for rotation flag to work i think you need to do something like ECE_ROTATIONFLAG aswell,,

173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 7:59 PM,oh,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 8:00 PM,why do you need this item to be rotated anyway?,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,07/29/2020 8:00 PM,whats wrong with setting the rotation 1 line after creating it,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,07/29/2020 8:00 PM,then it might collide with other objects I'm spawning,,

150792841671475201,rdiddyau,08/15/2020 6:20 PM,For some reason it just seems nails is the only abberation to this rule,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,08/15/2020 6:21 PM,the quantmin/max is used for when spawned in the world i believe,,👍 (1)
137658517615149056,helkhiana,08/15/2020 6:21 PM,not in the zombies,,
150792841671475201,rdiddyau,08/15/2020 6:21 PM,I thought so too but I also couldn't find anywhere for the zeds to reflect the min/max quantities,,
150792841671475201,rdiddyau,08/15/2020 6:21 PM,It only references the item itself,,
