743565979258454101,affenb3rt,04/15/2023 9:25 PM,"No. As said. The player does not have a body temperature. He just feels cold, warm etc. Which is translated to the heatcomfort which again takes several factors into account. Like general temperature of the time of the day, being close to a heat source like a fireplace, having a heatsource in the inventory. All those are handled in environment.c",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,04/15/2023 9:27 PM,Also not true. Heat comfort is the comfort. Heat buffer has its own player stat,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,04/15/2023 9:28 PM,Also not true. It gets the reference to the playerstat for the heatcomfort. Which can be used to get the current value but also set or add to it,,

214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:31 PM,we can convert `player.GetStatHeatComfort()` to temp,,
214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:32 PM,accuratelt then check that value to add effects or widgets whatsoever,,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,04/15/2023 9:32 PM,instead of calling me out on something i might be mistaken on it would be nice if you explained how it does work,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,04/15/2023 9:33 PM,Yes. It comes from somewhere. But take the stat literally. It's the heatcomfort. You can feel cold without having a low body temperature. It is two different pairs of shoes. On namalsk it's generally cold because the ever present factor of the general temperature of the time of the day is generally low. So the character generally feels more cold then on let's say chernarus. But that does not mean he also must have a lower body temperature (as said there isn't such thing anyways),,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,04/15/2023 9:34 PM,"I did mention that I am unsure, all i know is that what Environment.temperature is is reflected to the player",,
214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:35 PM,yeah the anim manager made me realise that. It is only about if the player feels cold or not,,
526470800572809227,progger,04/15/2023 9:35 PM,"@SalvaeniDayZ i assume u want to balance your temps, start with envo, and not player temps",,
214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:36 PM,But for the sake of cleaner stuff and varables to use we convert the heatcmfort to a temperature value and check that value to see if we do an action or not,,
214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:36 PM,so it kind of follows the same measure as outside temperature,,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,04/15/2023 9:37 PM,That's totally up to your use case If you want to translate the heatcomfort stat value to something else. However it might make more sense to simply normalize the value in a range of 0-1.0 depending on its min and max value and work this thresholds here,,
214154100080640001,r22rstern,04/15/2023 9:38 PM,ahhh true.,,

Everything seems okay (btw how can I change load order?)

But when I try to change print message for the **FirstMod** right from Workbench and re-compile it that's what I get from output:
