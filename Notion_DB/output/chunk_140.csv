But then I asked it to count the number of double letters in the word `letter`.  It can't do it. I was shocked. So I tried at length to get it to identify double letters. Nope. No can do. I guess that is somehow outside the scope of its training.,,

Sometimes you get it because you are calling on a game object too early before the game has had a chance to instantiate it.  Sometimes its in code you created because you forgot to instantiate your own object.```class example
{
    array<string> myarray;  // this is the definition. It tells the compiler what myarray will be but doesn't create it
    
    void init()
    {
         myarray = new array<string>;  // this is the instantiation.  It tells the compiler to create the object, reserve memory for it, etc    
    }
    
    void usemyarray()
    {
        myarray.Insert(""Now I can use the array because it has been instantiated"");  // This line throw a null pointer error if you did not do the instantiation step.

(1) An RPC is a one way communication from source  to target. An RPC has two parts.  A `sendRpc` instruction that runs on the source (e.g. the server) and the main method which runs on the target (e.g. client) (or the other way around).  (2) If communications need to go both ways then you need two RPC.  (3) you pass data through an RPC with the Param<> template. Param1<string> to pass one variable, Param1<string,int> to pass to variables, and so on.  Finally, RPC themselves are super simple. If your RPC doesn't work its almost always because you have a typo in one of your method signatures.",,

600793545594634241,kpro1982,01/15/2023 11:12 AM,"I think this is it -- `class ItemActionsWidget extends ScriptedWidgetEventHandler` ```    
protected void SetInteractActionIcon(string actionWidget, string actionIconFrameWidget, string actionIconWidget, string actionIconTextWidget)
    {
        string keyName = string.Empty;
        Widget widget, frameWidget;
        ImageWidget iconWidget;
        TextWidget textWidget;
        
        widget = m_Root.FindAnyWidget(actionWidget);
        Class.CastTo(frameWidget, widget.FindAnyWidget(actionIconFrameWidget));
        Class.CastTo(iconWidget, widget.FindAnyWidget(actionIconWidget));
        Class.CastTo(textWidget, widget.FindAnyWidget(actionIconTextWidget));

        //! get name of key which is used for UAAction input 
        UAInput i1 = GetUApi().GetInputByName(""UAAction""); 
        
        i1.SelectAlternative(0); //! select first alternative (which is the primary bind)
        for (int c = 0; c < i1.BindKeyCount(); c++)
        {
              int _hc = i1.GetBindKey(0);
              keyName = GetUApi().GetButtonName(_hc);
        }

        // uses text in floating widget
        iconWidget.Show(false);
        textWidget.SetText(keyName);
        textWidget.Show(true);    
    }```",,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,01/15/2023 11:16 AM,"In the above, I'd try experiementing with the iconWidget -- set its show to true. I think that is what you want. It'l be an image instead of a textWdiget. If you wanted a [C], you'd just have to change the keyname = 'c'. But for an image, I think it'll be a bit more work. Look in `class ActionTargetsCursor extends ScriptedWidgetEventHandler` for an example of how to use it:```
    protected void PrepareCursorContent()
    {
        int health = -1;
        int cargoCount = 0;
        int q_type = 0;
        int q_min, q_max = -1;
        float q_cur = -1.0;
        
        //! item health
        health = GetItemHealth();
        SetItemHealth(health, ""item"", ""item_health_mark"", m_HealthEnabled);    
        //! quantity
        GetItemQuantity(q_type, q_cur, q_min, q_max);
        //! cargo in item
        GetItemCargoCount(cargoCount);
        //! fill the widget with data
        SetItemQuantity(q_type, q_cur, q_min, q_max, ""item"", ""item_quantity_pb"", ""item_quantity_text"", m_QuantityEnabled);
        SetInteractActionIcon(""interact"", ""interact_icon_frame"", ""interact_btn_inner_icon"", ""interact_btn_text"");
        SetItemDesc(GetItemDesc(m_Interact), cargoCount, ""item"", ""item_desc"");
        SetActionWidget(m_Interact, GetActionDesc(m_Interact), ""interact"", ""interact_action_name"");

        SetInteractActionIcon(""continuous_interact"", ""continuous_interact_icon_frame"", ""continuous_interact_btn_inner_icon"", ""continuous_interact_btn_text"");
        SetActionWidget(m_ContinuousInteract, GetActionDesc(m_ContinuousInteract), ""continuous_interact"", ""continuous_interact_action_name"");

        SetActionWidget(m_Single, GetActionDesc(m_Single), ""single"", ""single_action_name"");
        SetActionWidget(m_Continuous, GetActionDesc(m_Continuous), ""continuous"", ""continuous_action_name"");
        SetMultipleItemAction(""single_mlt_wrapper"", ""single_mlt_wrapper_not_select"");
        SetMultipleContinuousItemAction(""continuous_mlt_wrapper"", ""continuous_mlt_wrapper_not_select"");
        SetMultipleInteractAction(""interact_mlt_wrapper"", ""interact_mlt_wrapper_not_select"");
        SetMultipleContinuousInteractAction(""continuous_interact_mlt_wrapper"", ""continuous_interact_mlt_wrapper_not_select"");
