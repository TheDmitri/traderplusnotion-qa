167659450142818306,original_six,07/18/2021 8:10 AM,"yeah thats what i ended up doing

```c

If you use Mikero's tools, you can extract mem points and the modelcfg essentially out of a model. Gives you better insight on that side of things.

As for the scripting, if your concept is not far off from how the vanilla system works, don't bother to create something from scratch unless you are going for that ""custom custom++ custom""",,💪 (1)

If one mod would not call super ThatMethod would not be called for each mod loaded after the respective mod not calling super,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,07/22/2021 3:57 PM,And would also result in the situation that the original ThatMethod would never be called. That's why super is so important to keep the logic of other mods intact. There only very rare cases where one would not want to call super,,

My friend is currently setting up COOP dayz server using eAI (I am working on setting that for our uses too) and he asked me for help with one litthe thing. The handheld transceiver in dayz can be hung from backpack and he want's them to be able to activate them without using inventory screen ei just look at them should give you on/off option. Since I am the only one from the group who ever touched DayZ tools he asked me. I tried hard for last 3days but since I never done any serious scripting and last time I touched dayz tools was 2years ago I am bit lost. I was pointed here by nice lady called Mar from Survivalist server with notion that I could find some people to help me with this pickle. If you have any ideas how this can be done or have functional script for this please let me know. I have no problems admiting I am noob as programing is not my forte and there are people here way more skilled in this than I am.

a simulation tick can also refer to the `EOnSimulate` method.

You want to make sure that you are only calling that function once every time either of those functions are called and you want to make sure you aren't calling it in `DayZGame::OnUpdate` or `Mission'x'::OnUpdate` since those run every frame unless you are certain it will be called once in that simulation tick",,
