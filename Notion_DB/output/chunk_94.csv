Since I am the only one from the group who ever touched DayZ tools he asked me. I tried hard for last 3days but since I never done any serious scripting and last time I touched dayz tools was 2years ago I am bit lost. I was pointed here by nice lady called Mar from Survivalist server with notion that I could find some people to help me with this pickle.

a simulation tick can also refer to the `EOnSimulate` method.

384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:31 PM,let me know if that worked üôÇ,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:31 PM,oh and you might need `bool CanDisplayAttachmentSlot`,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:31 PM,"return just true then, cause you want them to always show right?",,
105616222434893824,spurgle,07/27/2021 8:32 PM,CanDisplayAttachmentSlot only hides/unhides the attachments not the cargo??,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:32 PM,i think so,,
105616222434893824,spurgle,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,maybe in conjunction with lockinventory?? could work...,,
164872154154795008,zelik,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,Yeah but with the inventory locked and it returning true then you should have your solution,,
164872154154795008,zelik,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,Exactly,,
105616222434893824,spurgle,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,^^^,,
105616222434893824,spurgle,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,ill give it a go üôÇ,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:33 PM,there we go,,
164872154154795008,zelik,07/27/2021 8:34 PM,But you never know with this stuff until you try. That's the worst part .,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,07/27/2021 8:35 PM,Interesting issues. I‚Äôll have to test my ammo box when I get home. I had it NOT display Cargo when there wasn‚Äôt anything in it.,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:35 PM,wait what,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:35 PM,how you can put something in if it doesnt show when empty?,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,07/27/2021 8:36 PM,attach on selection only?,,
