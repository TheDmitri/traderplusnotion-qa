456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:10 AM,and the weight limit threshold,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,i think that is part the weight system,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,that affects your movement,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,OpenFile seems somewhat picky about paths tho..,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,but dont really touch that,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,if you change it from 1000g to like 1,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:11 AM,1 kg would be 1 gram,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:12 AM,i don't think thats a good idea,,
82998531970826240,that1drifter,11/13/2018 12:12 AM,the threshold of 5000 means you can carry 5 Kilograms before your stamina bar starts to shrink,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:12 AM,i want to up the stamina but idk exactly what number to up with it for weight because i upeed the stamina but it seems people get overweight quicker,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:12 AM,many reports people having issues with stamina and running,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:15 AM,Guys what does scr and filepatching does ? I never understood that,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:16 AM,scrAllowFileWrite seems to be a new flag that allows scripts on the server/client to access the filesystem,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:17 AM,Probably because with all these mods on the workshop it's not necessarily a great idea for them to have file system access unless the server knows what they're doing and has opted in,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:17 AM,"filepatching might be something to do with using files outside of .pbos, I'm not sure",,
82998531970826240,that1drifter,11/13/2018 12:18 AM,-filePatching allows the game to load data not packed in pbo,,
82998531970826240,that1drifter,11/13/2018 12:20 AM,"like when people extract ""dta\scripts.pbo"" to a ""scripts"" folder in the server/game root folder",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:21 AM,Thanks guys let me save this important info !,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:22 AM,Seems OpenFile() only wants to work if you're using the prefix $profile...,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/13/2018 12:22 AM,anyone have a way to add now to game weather effect for snowfall,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 12:22 AM,Even putting the exact path to the profile doesn't seem to work,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:35 AM,use ` \\ `,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:35 AM,not \,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/13/2018 12:35 AM,Does `$CurrentDir:\\` work for OpenFIle?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:35 AM,yeah,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 12:36 AM,`$profile:\\data.db` as well,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/13/2018 12:49 AM,Is there a prefix for the mission folder like `$mission` ?,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:01 AM,Hm,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:01 AM,I can open say: $profile:\\MissionScriptLoader.log for append,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:01 AM,But not $CurrentDir:\\MissionScriptLoader.log,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:02 AM,(double slashes are in),,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:02 AM,Discord is stripping them it seems,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:02 AM,did you put the log in game root?,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:03 AM,Creating a new file,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:03 AM,"As I said, it works just fine for $profile",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:04 AM,you should try `$CurrentDir:\\a_folder\\file.log`,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:04 AM,to see if CurrentDir works,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:04 AM,maybe you just cant write to root game folder,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:09 AM,Not even `$CurrentDir:\\mpmissions\\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\\MissionScriptLoader.log` seems to work,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:10 AM,tried with `$CurrentDir:\\logs\MissionScriptLoader.log` too,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:11 AM,hm,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:11 AM,maybe  CurrentDir only works for reading speciific files,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:12 AM,it does work for my when i load layout files for example,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:12 AM,but i also written map files to my root,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 1:12 AM,maybe removed since scrallowfilewrite,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:12 AM,Yeah,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:12 AM,I've also read files from the mission folder before,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:18 AM,Ah I can use FileMode.READ with $currentDir,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:19 AM,Which is all I've done in the past,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 1:19 AM,Whereas I wrote to $profile before..,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/13/2018 2:04 AM,Current Dir stopped working yea,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/13/2018 2:04 AM,Does not allow me to go into anything apart from profile,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/13/2018 2:05 AM,u were never meant to be able to access $currentDir,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/13/2018 2:05 AM,u only could because they havent pushed that security patch until now,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/13/2018 2:06 AM,So no more curr dir:(,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/13/2018 3:22 AM,"currdir works for .txts, at least for me",,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/13/2018 3:30 AM,Or does the command line param work now?,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 3:32 AM,but not without parameter,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,11/13/2018 3:32 AM,I saw Kerkkoh talking about it earlier,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 3:34 AM,"Yup you need -scrAllowFileWrite to be able to use either OpenFile() with FileMode.APPEND and/or FPrintln, tested just now",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 3:34 AM,right now yeah current dir does not work,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 3:34 AM,only $profile,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/13/2018 3:34 AM,But there also appears to be additional limitations on the paths you can open with OpenFile() at least with a write file mode,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/13/2018 3:35 AM,Ahh ok. Atleast we can now use it.,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,11/13/2018 3:35 AM,@Corey you were never suppose to be able to do current dir apparently,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/13/2018 3:41 AM,They both exist for what seems to be your purpose,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/13/2018 3:41 AM,should be working without modding or anything,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/13/2018 3:42 AM,It does work the path,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/13/2018 3:42 AM,But only to read,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/13/2018 3:42 AM,Yeah of course currentdir is inside the exe. Missions use it,,
