```player.PredictiveTakeEntityToHands(itemToHands)```
This does actually work with a weapon. The char takes the weapon from the shoulder to the hand - perfect

but If I want to put the weapon back again with:

```player.PredictiveTakeEntityAsAttachment(itemInHands)```
It does not work well. So based on 
```.GetEntityInHands()``` it does actually remove the item from the hand and set the item in hands to NULL
but when I connect to my server and watch the player taking the gun as attachment, it just plays the animation, but the weapon stays inside 
the hand. It is not attached to the shoulder and I cant take another item to the hand. Looks like a put back and take immediately to hands again animation.

Menu:

Context:

Just recently made the changes, it's not esthetical as it should be, and I should never call the `OnClick` method of the context, at least it doesn't for the Inventory in game; my first thought was: ""The layout is not focused, so the game ignore the content"", so I added a focus on the layout, but still nothing.

I can use breakpoints inside my mod, but i can't recompile script (recompile file on host function) as it says that it can't find type (which exist in the core scripts) and after that any debugging is no longer possible until game/server restart.
