And in my mod I do this as well for some buildings. There is a direct conflict and one of them needs to be ‚Äòmodded class‚Äô. Problem is I can‚Äôt change my to modded cu it throws and error if the class isn‚Äôt defined. And vise Versa. Is there away around this? An IF statement persay?",,

I can jst about manage the asset creation side of things but I'm looking for a little help with the scripting side of things.
Can anyone point me in the direction of some good reading material?

I'm basically looking to do something similar to how tanning was done in previous versions of the game.
Instead of a barrel, a fermenter and ingredients to create beer.
I have a few ideas, but I could really use some solid documentation which I haven't been able to find.
Thanks in advance!",,

When I inherit it from RockBase, the Action won't show up when I have a Pickaxe and I'm next to it.
