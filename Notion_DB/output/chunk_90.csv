I.e I've created a green variation of the Courier Bag to dye with the standard Courier Bag and plant material, but it gives me the option to dye the green variation after I dyed the standard one. I think this is because I used the vanilla class in the recipe

> protected Widget m_Widget; // all protected members are prefixed with m_
I got behind the `m_` convention (I don't even know why lol), imo prefixes and suffixes should have no place in variable naming, it doesn't give any contribute to understand what variable is it.
If I need to call that variable from within the class I would prefer MUCH more using `this`, I like a bit more verbosity, it makes the code more readable and maintanable in the long run.
But since I mainly use the Workbench to code, I would understand why you would prefer `m_` over `this`

> Widget MyFunc()
>     {
regarding parenthesis, I always put them on the same line; if I would need to better visualize a scope I would rather prefer adding an empty line
Also muscle memory is just too strong lol
I'm personally not a huge fan of mixing the two styles, since , at least personally, the inconsistency really bugs me ahhahaha


in all the IDEs I used, I've built my muscle memory to spam `CTRL`+`ALT`+`L` or `SHIFT`+`ALT`+`L` to either reformat the code or just reindent the lines
So I'm used to see little spacing added automatically, like this
```
class MyClass {
}
```
or for example especially the iterative for:
```
for(int i = 0; i < 69; i++)

135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:46 PM,yeah but i dont like Community Frameworks formatting so ill be a stick in their ass,,
137994686852890624,jadfi,06/03/2021 12:47 PM,"usually prettier is crying at me and my boss likes curly brackets on the same line, so I format like that at work - usually not by choice because it just gets auto formatted",,
207902577713479680,simonvic,06/03/2021 12:47 PM,"speaking for experience, I like more verbosity when necessary, in larger codebases it makes the code more readable and maintanable IMO",,
137994686852890624,jadfi,06/03/2021 12:47 PM,"when modding, curlies go on a new line",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:49 PM,"verbosity != readability, personally",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:49 PM,but im also very used to my own coding style,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:50 PM,i can have variable name ActiveSearchBarDataAfterCacheClearUnderTheChristmasTree,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,06/03/2021 12:52 PM,"but in certain cases I really think is necessary (especially since in Enforce parameters names contribute to the method signature)
take this as an example:
```csharp
class PPEExhaustedAnimation : PPELoopedParams {    
    protected float stamina = 100;
    
    override void onInit(){
        setVignetteColor(PPEManager.getPPEColor(0,0,0,0));
    }
    
    override void onAnimate(float deltaTime){
        float power = Math.AbsFloat(Math.Sin(getTime() * 2.5) / Math.Clamp(stamina, 40, 100));
        setRadialBlur(power, power);
        setVignetteIntensity(power * 20);
    }
    
    void setStamina(float stamina){
        this.stamina = stamina;
    }
}
```
this is just a dumb example, but how would you call the parameter in the method `setStamina` to make it clear to whoever calls it, to know what that variable is? Yes obviously you may call it playerStamina, stam, s, or whatever, but IMO it only leads to this:
```
mySuperSecretMethod(float s, array<int> aI, int s2)
```",,
207902577713479680,simonvic,06/03/2021 12:53 PM,"oh wait, I agree on this",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:53 PM,"the variable in class scope will be `PascalCase` , but local variables are `snake_case`",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:54 PM,"function variables, and locally declared variables are snake",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:54 PM,so i would do,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,06/03/2021 12:54 PM,"as everything, there isn't a ""definitive"" coding style for every occasion IMO, that's why there are many lol
And it depends on many factors",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 12:54 PM,"```
class PPEExhaustedAnimation

137994686852890624,jadfi,06/03/2021 12:57 PM,in personal projects I seem to have adapted putting curly brackets on new lines just because I find that more readable nowadays,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/03/2021 1:07 PM,maybe they have a giant chart in HQ that shows you exactly what each level of abstraction is for,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,06/03/2021 1:07 PM,I'm pretty sure is caused by the legacy code carried over,,

Can someone of you pls tell me why this is an syntax error?",,
513834825937977364,lugge2,06/04/2021 12:21 AM,its loading without the [] but than the script is still not working,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/04/2021 12:22 AM,having an empty `[]` is just trying to access a part of that array without giving it an index,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/04/2021 12:22 AM,the variable itself is just WatterDiffuse,,
513834825937977364,lugge2,06/04/2021 12:23 AM,"ah so if i use ``` materialLugge.SetParam(""ReflectionColor"",  WaterDiffuse ); ``` it is loading 0, 0, 0, 0 from the array?",,

you need to create a new folder called ""custom_mapping"" or something similar if you like, and put your init (with a different name ofc) here.
and place the include function in your server default init.c or offline
`
#include ""$CurrentDir:Missions\\NameOfMission\\custom_mapping\\sample.c""


 //that for COM
Mission CreateCustomMission(string path)
{    
    if ( GetGame().IsServer() && GetGame().IsMultiplayer() )
        return new CommunityOfflineServer();

    return new CommunityOfflineClient();
}


//Spawn helper function 
void SpawnObject( string type, vector position, vector orientation )
{
    auto obj = GetGame().CreateObject( type, position );
    obj.SetPosition( position );
    obj.SetOrientation( orientation );
    obj.SetOrientation( obj.GetOrientation() ); //Collision fix
    obj.Update();

}

void main()
{
    //*name file init *(); - sample
bla bla bla();

}

`void *NameOfYourInit*()

SpawnObject ( x y z and more)

I have a model of a folding shovel...
And want to animate the folding action instead of just swapping the item

So when folded, it can only attach or unfold

And when unfolded, it can dig ect and fold....

I did think register a state depending on its animation state and then use that in the action scripts similar to a door or barrel.

But think that would mean I'd have to mod all the existing shovel actions as well I think...

Setting all the values in class ArmorType to ""damage=0;"" will negate any damage
That would be the proper way but sounds like a lot of work

Alternatively maybe just healing the HP back to max in EEHitBy could work as well, a bit of a hack but less work
```cs
if (dmgZone.Contains(""door""))
    SetHealthMax(dmgZone,"""");
