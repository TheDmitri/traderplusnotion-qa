94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/28/2023 11:51 PM,From my understanding there is no major difference other than maybe primitive size. Both are floating point types. Both are 'imprecise'. (This is C#) but C++ says double is more precise than float.,,

546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 5:35 PM,Thanks for help. I going to test your code. Just what's difference between missions/name.ChernarusPlus and 5_Mission ?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 5:37 PM,"one is a script module, the other is mission files",,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 5:40 PM,so 5_Mission is an external addition without changing the main mission,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 5:44 PM,5_Mission is a module of base game scripts for missions,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 5:57 PM,"I executed BriceSecondMod but I don't have any message.. And why I have this shit ? `Mission script has no main function, player connect will stay disabled!`",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 6:04 PM,i mean you need to run on a server,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 6:05 PM,not singleplayer,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:05 PM,"off course `start /D ""Z:\Jeux\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ"" DayZDiag_x64.exe ""-mod=P:\Mods\@BriceSecondMod"" -filePatching -server -config=serverDZ.cfg`",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 6:23 PM,What ever mission you're loading doesn't have a proper init.c setup then,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 6:23 PM,Your mission is stated in your serverDZ.cfg,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:31 PM,I used the init.c given on doc. Maybe because it's Singleplayer,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1091399470392021022/image.png,
185896664110727168,osodirty,03/31/2023 6:40 PM,And we found the issue.,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,03/31/2023 6:41 PM,Definitely because it's single player. Always test scripts in an mp environment.,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:42 PM,But if I want test server class?,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,03/31/2023 6:44 PM,Mp environment means on a server. So you have scripts from both client and server loaded. Sp is generally only good for texturing/modeling tests.,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:45 PM,mhhh I see. Did you know how can I launch server+client environment ?,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:45 PM,doc says just Server or Client,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/31/2023 6:45 PM,use a multiplayer mission,,
546747364619190293,briceharper,03/31/2023 6:47 PM,"okay so I trying to find this. And after, I start server, and client or just client with -mission option ?",,

We have this script to make the player's body model invisible while wearing the suit. It works for the player themself but other players can still see their body model making the suits a bit unpolished

Using SetInvisible(bool) which we know only works for players within render distance, so I have tried to implement it into missiongameplay but it still only works for the player themself

We have another script to 'hide' the player's clothing which is working. It's just their player model that continues to show for other players

can't even drag the invisible items off the slots when this happens

invisible clothing remains on the character when suit is removed, but after a relog it re-syncs and the gear is back where it should be (on the character) and the invisible items are gone

when the suit is equipped it moves the player inventory to the armband slot, which has the same inventory as the player (minus shoulder and melee slots) and gives them the invisible clothing

I have this gun, where the back magazine is our normal loaded magazine.
I want the front slot to be a spare magazine, which you can attach.
So I created a new slot, added it to gun and magazine.

Now the gun obviously would always load the magazine, which would be fine if none is loaded.
If one is loaded, it switches the one with the one I want to attach as spare.

Anyone got an easy idea of how I would do this?
