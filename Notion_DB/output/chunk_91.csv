i sorted that delay i was after between my animation and lambda thanks @dab i ended up using a .callLater in the action script. works a treat.

now onto the next issue.
invView 2.

im try to get rid of the 2nd p3d, but to do this i need a 2nd invView point, simple enough...
but why wont it work??
just tried something basic like this
```c

135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/22/2021 2:00 AM,the magic is in SetRespawnBase and OnInvokeConnect,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/22/2021 2:01 AM,"basically, when the client chooses to respawn back at base, it inserts the players id into the `m_BaseRespawns` array, then OnInvokeConnect checks for the value in `m_BaseRespawns`",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,06/22/2021 2:01 AM,"so, you store the playerid of the respawning players in that array, then OnInvokeConnect you check for it, and then send them to your magic location",,

For example - trying to change the fuelConsumption on a hatchback_02. I know its in the config.cpp for that but I cant find the config.cpp that houses the hatchback_02. Same with a lot of different items. Say I want to change the cargo size of a barrel, That too would be housed in its config.cpp but i cant find it anywhere. 
So, my main question is where do I find these config.cpp's and if I'm wrong and these variables arent hiding in config.cpps then where are they?
I've got the P drive sorted, and scoured it as best I could but to no avail. Any help would be great. Especially if I can get anyone to sit down and maybe show me the ins and outs. Thanks for reading all of this craziness lol",,

780569771720441926,[FactionWarZ] Dane_Gleeballs#8825,06/24/2021 6:08 PM,if they can just bulk stash food then they have no reason to interact outside being in their base,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:11 PM,i might release the mod..i am just hesitant cause people,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:27 PM,search for `SetCookingTime`,,👍🏻 (1)
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:28 PM,you need to figure it out by yourself after that,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,06/24/2021 6:30 PM,Could just include a define on the slim chances someone else wants to mod that function? @Helkhiana,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,06/24/2021 6:30 PM,Or I mean ifdefs on the override and if you add the define that override is not compiled,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:31 PM,i guess,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:31 PM,but we all know how well ifdefs work,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:31 PM,unless you do the hinky dependency,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:31 PM,tbh no one should need to override same function,,
196845794513518592,shaggoth,06/24/2021 6:32 PM,:feelsGunMan: noone shall,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,06/24/2021 6:32 PM,Personally I doubt anyone else will want to mod that unless they're literally doing what you're doing now and perhaps you can use an array that people can insert their own classes for in that use case,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:32 PM,oh yeah it is using a config with array of classes already,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,06/24/2021 6:33 PM,Yeah as long as *that* is modifiable I think it should be fine,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:33 PM,for example if people would want to also have salt preserving like PF had before..,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,06/24/2021 6:33 PM,then yeah they might need to override the whole thing as well,,
