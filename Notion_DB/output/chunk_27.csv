148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 2:07 PM,isn't that needed to update the orientation?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 2:07 PM,heck even with one SetOrientation it crashes the server,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 2:07 PM,so idk,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 2:09 PM,`Fixed: Invisible dynamic events and custom objects`,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 2:09 PM,Sounds good,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:14 PM,SetPosition,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:14 PM,Thats what breaks it,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:14 PM,Otherwise the above code does seem to work,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 3:16 PM,so maybe they spawn in the right position instead of needing to be spawned elsewhere then re-positioned,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,03/29/2019 3:16 PM,Unless they fixed it the setposition is required,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 3:16 PM,Okay static structures spawned with script are fixed and no longer invisible,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,03/29/2019 3:16 PM,Remember when your bridge was all fucked waaay back when,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,03/29/2019 3:16 PM,and the fix was to reset the position?,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,03/29/2019 3:17 PM,The game takes it's own liberties on the position you spawn it at,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 3:17 PM,"yeah I had to start them at 0 0 0, then move them where I wanted from 0.63 until now",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:17 PM,The position does seem to work now,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:17 PM,When using it right after creating the object set position is crashing the server (and client if using local),,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 3:17 PM,the dam was a perfect example for testing it,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 3:19 PM,Have testewd Object placement with that code just 1min ago and my code works,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:20 PM,Hmm then why is mine crashing the server when I tried? Hmm,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 3:20 PM,yeah I thought the same,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:21 PM,Idk guess I'll just go to sleep and be happy the code works at all,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 3:21 PM,have a good one 😄,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 3:21 PM,returning it as an object is redundant unless you're using the object outside of the method for spawning it,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 3:21 PM,it's safe to be a void,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 3:21 PM,I also need to check if its a barrel and store it in an array,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/29/2019 3:22 PM,Yeah needed to add it into an array so I could delete it if the server admin wished to delete the wall,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 5:21 PM,I think the easiest is to create a custom config with the same name as the car,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 5:22 PM,"similar to how ChawDinky did DinkyItems, but then just basically overriding the damage handling config stuff",,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 7:21 PM,One Question: what if I want to override the constructor of a class with a modded class? 🤔,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:21 PM,"you don't have to, each modded class seems to have it's own constructor",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:21 PM,separate to the base class,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 7:21 PM,Okay thats nice had that in mind but not confirmed ^^,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:22 PM,I've tested this with ItemBase,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 7:23 PM,ah alright I need to register netsync variables for the CarScript class ^^,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:24 PM,constructor is the ideal place,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 7:24 PM,Because they deleted the Init() I have to use the constructor ^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,03/29/2019 7:24 PM,yeah 😃,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:24 PM,getting that object oriented C style code brain going,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:25 PM,but that's good if you find the solution,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:26 PM,I normally hold off until I'm certain,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:26 PM,until the last couple days I hadn't filed a ticket in a while,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:26 PM,most of the issues I found had been reported during the time,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:27 PM,"And for the constructor, I will make a feedback to move every constructor code to a Init function or something like that",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:27 PM,"Because I want to create a complete overhaul of the game, and most of stuff doesn't needed at all",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:27 PM,"that would be better for modding, it'd be more clear",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:27 PM,and you can't disable things that are inside constructor,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:27 PM,and it's really hard after to disable things,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:28 PM,it's touch and go as to which classes call an Init method in it's constructor,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:28 PM,"maybe, when you are creating code, it's weird to make it inside function, but this would be flawless for us modders",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:28 PM,yeah I need to actually take that feedback into mind myself for times I make classes that could be modded,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,03/29/2019 7:29 PM,"Yeah, with Expansion, I modified a lot of our class for modding compatibility",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:29 PM,I'll add that to my todo list for KillFeed and BaseBuildingLogs,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:30 PM,I don't think many people think of modding a mod rather than trying to edit and repack it,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:30 PM,but that could change with some examples getting out there too,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:34 PM,I will check haha,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/29/2019 7:34 PM,"but it also goes to a dedicated file, which is less clutter to pick out the events",,

102121607417327616,rvn,03/29/2019 9:22 PM,You need to generate a lookup table in order to do so,,
102121607417327616,rvn,03/29/2019 9:23 PM,"Oh just to clarify, the GDPR issue here is that you can use the data from one subject (our game) and link it with another subject (steam data) to gather info",,

actually I happened to have actionlockdoors open behind this window and peeked over to see an example in core code for a Class.CastTo call 😛",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:06 AM,"I personally don't use that one, I use an alternate method",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:06 AM,but there are several ways to safely cast objects,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:07 AM,How did you learn this?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:07 AM,"```
modded class PlayerBase

    Man m_Man;

}
```",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:07 AM,I feel that I am just swimming in a sea of mess because theres no docs for me to read,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:07 AM,debug print log files actually,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:07 AM,"when it tells you that there is an unsafe downcast, it suggests what to use instead",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,like in that code snippet what is auto?,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,I dont see it defined anywhere,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,is it a class,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,auto detects whatever class the object is set as,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,that you cast to or something,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:08 AM,from the left side,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:09 AM,`auto.Cast` detects the class from the object `m_Man`,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:09 AM,sometimes it's faster to type than some class names,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:09 AM,So why would I want to cast?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:10 AM,"it's all about the way object inheritance works. If you don't cast safely, you might actually not get the expected results from an object",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:11 AM,"plus, if you don't cast, you'll spam your script log file to huge in no time",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:11 AM,and get a lot of complaints from admins,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:11 AM,😛,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:11 AM,I still dont really understand why I would cast . Could you tell me a real life example?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:11 AM,it also improves performance in some degree,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:12 AM,Something id regularly come across,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:12 AM,I can indeed,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:12 AM,"```

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:12 AM,okay so for context here as a case study of casting,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:13 AM,"`Building building` is our object, so `Building` is the class `building` is the object's name",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:14 AM,so you'd want to cast the object to being a Building class,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:17 AM,So it changes the object from type object to type building?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:17 AM,yes,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:18 AM,more specifically case sensitive with caps at the start,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:18 AM,case is important in enfscript,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:18 AM,`Building != building`,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:18 AM,😃,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:19 AM,Okay. That makes a little bit more sense,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:19 AM,I find it hard to figure it all out sometimes,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:20 AM,what does that do? makes building the same as Building,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:20 AM,"that's not pseudo code either, that returns if your object `building` is the type of class you are seeking, in this case `Building`",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,03/30/2019 6:21 AM,It returns a bool based on whether ``building`` is a type of ``Building``,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,03/30/2019 6:21 AM,"so with our example before, Building building, would return true",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/30/2019 6:21 AM,Awww okay,,

207937663540527105,CitizenZ#5054,04/04/2019 4:13 PM,"@Deleted User I dont think it was because of the mission addon, I think its because it cant find it for some reason?",,
207937663540527105,CitizenZ#5054,04/04/2019 4:13 PM,but I did verify,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/04/2019 4:15 PM,for me it downloaded like 500mb after verifying,,
207937663540527105,CitizenZ#5054,04/04/2019 4:15 PM,It was probably cause you had some of the game deleted ^_^,,

226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:34 PM,"For those that were adding custom animations:
 ```GetDayZPlayerType().AddItemInHandsProfileIK(""DUG_Cigarette_Base"", ""dz/anims/workspaces/player/player_main/player_main_1h.asi"", toolsOneHanded, ""dz/anims/anm/player/ik/gear/thermometer.anm"");```
in PlayerBase.c init().
I think wrapping them in:
```if ( !GetGame().IsServer() || !GetGame().IsMultiplayer() ) {
```
Is probably a good idea. Been trying to figure out why we were crashing and this is one thing we changed from 1.01 to 1..02.  Added the check, and testing now.
@Jacob_Mango @Not A Banana  tagging you guys as well",,

207328818203983872,notabanana,04/04/2019 10:35 PM,@Cleetus found the same problem,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,04/04/2019 10:35 PM,Basically if anyone loads in with that skin the server crashes,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:36 PM,well this is also a thing,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:37 PM,because that skin is not always reported,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:37 PM,and other servers aren't crashing all the time,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,04/04/2019 10:37 PM,`and other servers aren't crashing all the time` multiple servers are having a crash right after the head stuff,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:37 PM,might be an unrelated issue or related,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:38 PM,I know the AddItemInHandsProfileIK trick was mentioned here a few weeks ago,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:38 PM,might be some others picked up and added that,,
226007936546111498,ctlaltdelammo,04/04/2019 10:41 PM,with all the time I mean we had 23 crashes in 17 hours,,
