137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:46 AM,I believe its an action,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:46 AM,Combination of items are usually recipes,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:46 AM,Interaction is actions,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:49 AM,Usually i just look for a similar kind,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:50 AM,Like you need the lockpick action,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:50 AM,Search for that,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/07/2020 9:50 AM,And can always dm if you need help,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,03/07/2020 10:37 AM,because bounding boxes are more precise than arma,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,03/07/2020 10:38 AM,so you can use check to know if your object is inside any bounding boxes,,
