181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:13 PM,By the game during the player game loop calculations. If you trace it back the mod command handlers are just empty placeholders for us to add additional code into `PlayerBase::CommandHandler()`,,
356744388447043584,s4mt3k,05/06/2022 5:14 PM,"Yeah ok Thats what i thought... just wanted to clarify it... 

It is a bit spammy isnt it? Had 200 Prints in one second ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

is there another function i could call that is ""slower"" ?!?!?! (INSIDE PLAYERBASE)",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:15 PM,"It is called every simulation step. So yeah I guess it is spammy 🙂
The question would do what you want to achieve. Do you want to do something on a certain action taking place or every X time interval or what is it?",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/06/2022 5:17 PM,probably would be better to do on contact and a raycast,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:18 PM,"Ah, well yes then that is the correct place to do something. Linking will have to be done in the function, detection can be done outside and passed into the function as a flag",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:19 PM,"preferably you would want to do it on events, but there are some situations you will not catch otherwise. So you simply cast a ray straight down every time - or add a little throttle to only execute it every n-th iteration.",,

356744388447043584,s4mt3k,05/06/2022 5:20 PM,OnContact was a good idea,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:21 PM,"As I said, oncontact will only work for a few physical collisions. It does not work for terrain or non active bodies you ""walk"" on. Might be enough for your usecase, but keep it in mind before thinking that the event is ""missing"" or something",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:22 PM,This becomes relevant when you want to get off the thing you were linked to,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/06/2022 5:25 PM,The problem is that the fall command only triggers after a certain height. If the terrain is uneven or some obstacle is right besides the exit the player will never enter that command,,

What about this then:

Make it a normal object like you have already and prevent players from picking it up.

If something happens to it you don't need to care since it wont be saved and be there again after restart",,

You can then spawn it used dayz editor yes.

Dayz editor will put a new on there at every server restart but that's fine since it wont survive a restart anyways",,

I made a CheckFlag in the class EVRStorm ( Namalsk Surival )

```c
modded class EVRStorm: NamWeatherEvent
{    
    bool soundFlag = false;
    override void InitPhaseClient(float phase_time) 
    {
        super.InitPhaseClient(phase_time);    
        SetSoundFlagTrue(soundFlag);
    }
    override void EndPhaseClient(float phase_time) 
    {
        super.EndPhaseClient(phase_time);
        SetSoundFlagFalse(soundFlag);
    }
    bool GetSoundFlag()
    {
        return soundFlag;
    };
    void SetSoundFlagTrue(bool soundFlag)
    {
        soundFlag = true;
        Print(""Flag TRUE settata"");
    };
    void SetSoundFlagFalse(bool soundFlag)
    {
        soundFlag = false;
        Print(""Flag FALSE settata"");
    };
    ```
I made this to have a Flag that say to me that the EVRStorm is started ( its ClientPhase)

Then i made a script in MissionGameplay in which i want that a Device ( in this case a GeigerCounter) start to playsound when the Flag is TRUe ( aka when `initPhaseclientStarts`)

```c
modded class MissionGameplay
{
    float freqGG = 3.00;
    float tempoGG;
    EVRStorm checkFlag;
    bool check = false;
    
    override void OnUpdate(float timeslice)
    {
        super.OnUpdate(timeslice);
        tempoGG += timeslice;
        Geiger gbMano;
        Battery9V pilaG;
        PlayerBase pippoG = PlayerBase.Cast(GetGame().GetPlayer());
        if(!pippoG)return;
        EntityAI inHandzG = pippoG.GetHumanInventory().GetEntityInHands();
        gbMano = Geiger.Cast(inHandzG);
        if(!gbMano)return;
        pilaG = Battery9V.Cast(gbMano.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""BatteryD""));
        
        if (gbMano)
        {    
            if( pilaG && pilaG.GetCompEM().GetEnergy() > 0 && gbMano.GetCompEM().IsWorking())
            {
                if (tempoGG >= freqGG)
                {        
                    
                    check = checkFlag.GetSoundFlag(); // here i get a NULLPOINTER CUZ checkFlag is NULL ( but if i made a check before it jumps all the part )v v v

                        if (check == true )
                        {
                            EffectSound sound;
                            gbMano.PlaySoundSet( sound, ""sound"", 0, 0 );
                            tempoGG = 0;

94225995581620224,itsatreee,05/17/2022 5:41 PM,You could enumerate over inventory and check items to match that type,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,05/17/2022 5:42 PM,You could also have a bool in Playerbase that flags when `OnInventoryEnter/Exit` is triggered for the item.,,
