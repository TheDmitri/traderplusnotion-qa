Is someone can help me to figure out how to set waypoints to a group of zombies.
I spent hours (a lot, really) to try to find a solution but whatever I do the zombies still moving randomly as vanilla ones.
I tried multiple solution and here is an example of code that I think it should work but it doesn't I don't know why.
```c++
class TestZombies_ManageWaypoints
{
    AIGroup m_AIGroupCustom;
    AIGroupBehaviour m_AIGroupBehaviour;
    BehaviourGroupInfectedPack m_BehaviourGroupInfectedPack;
    autoptr array< ref BehaviourGroupInfectedPackWaypointParams > wayPointsParamsList = new array< ref BehaviourGroupInfectedPackWaypointParams >;
    
    vector waypointPosition1 = ""4408 0 4144"";
    vector waypointPosition2 = ""4535 0 4146"";
    
    //// AffectWaypointsToTheInfecteds void is called 1 second after the zombies have spawned to be sure to not conflict with the vanilla spawn code (same result if called immediately)
    void AffectWaypointsToTheInfecteds(array< EntityAI > theInfectedsList) 
    {
        wayPointsParamsList.Clear();
        waypointPosition1[1] = GetGame().SurfaceY(waypointPosition1[0], waypointPosition1[2]);
        waypointPosition2[1] = GetGame().SurfaceY(waypointPosition2[0], waypointPosition2[2]);        
        wayPointsParamsList.Insert( new BehaviourGroupInfectedPackWaypointParams( waypointPosition1, 5.0 ) );
        wayPointsParamsList.Insert( new BehaviourGroupInfectedPackWaypointParams( waypointPosition2, 5.0 ) );
        // same result if I generate coords with ""FindPath""
        
        m_AIGroupCustom = GetGame().GetWorld().GetAIWorld().CreateGroup( ""DZInfectedPackBeh"" ); // same result with CreateDefaultGroup()  
        if (m_AIGroupCustom)
        {
            m_AIGroupBehaviour = AIGroupBehaviour.Cast(m_AIGroupCustom.GetBehaviour());
            if ( m_AIGroupBehaviour )
            {
                m_BehaviourGroupInfectedPack = BehaviourGroupInfectedPack.Cast( m_AIGroupBehaviour );
                if (m_BehaviourGroupInfectedPack)
                {
                    m_BehaviourGroupInfectedPack.SetWaypoints( wayPointsParamsList, 0, true, true );
                    m_BehaviourGroupInfectedPack.SetCurrentWaypoint(1);            
                }
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < theInfectedsList.Count(); ++i)
            {
                DayZCreatureAI creature = DayZCreatureAI.Cast(theInfectedsList.Get(i));
                if ( creature )
                {
                    AIAgent m_AIAgent = creature.GetAIAgent();
                    if (m_AIAgent)
                    {
                        AIGroup m_AIGroupDefault = m_AIAgent.GetGroup();
                        if (m_AIGroupDefault)
                            m_AIGroupDefault.RemoveAgent(m_AIAgent);     // remove from default vanilla group
                        
                        m_AIGroupCustom.AddAgent(m_AIAgent);            // add to my new custom group
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that if you don’t know how to move a group of zombies but know how to move a single one I'm interested too. 
Despite the time I spend on that problem I still don’t know how to simply say « Go Here », little bit sad, there is so much I could do with this « simple » feature (making my PvZmoD Dark Horde little bit less clunky to start with).

Note that I already search a solution on the discord and tried this :
```
zombieObject.GetAIAgent().GetGroup().GetBehaviour().SetWaypoints(wpParams,0,true,true);
```
but the «  SetWaypoints » is part of « BehaviourGroupInfectedPack » not « AIGroupBehaviour » that return GetBehaviour() and  I didn’t find a way to make it works even with casting or things like that.

Really hope someone here will be able to help me, I’m a little bit tired about that to be honest.",,

so, im a bit frustrated
i come from developing and making mods for other games, but i'm mad at how little documentation there is on how to make a mod for this game
all i'm trying to do is create a chat command that can be ran only on my steamid64 that puts an item in my inventory
what i'm mad at, is that the official bohemia interactive wiki doesn't define what definitions you can have, and most frustratingly of all, what each one is responsible for
i'm setting up the config.cpp right now, but i don't know what dependencies or defs to have in order to be able to interface with the chat

also: is there a way i can see what functions, globals, classes, etc. are available to me? is there a better wiki somewhere? something i can open in visual studio perhaps? i know this question has probably been asked before but i scrolled through the chat and couldn't find anything so i figure i'd ask

i greatly value your time, and thanks in advance
i haven't even started and this is already a headache

stupid question for a stupid person, made even more stupid that i haven't slept in 18 hours

i've watched the videos you guys requested, but they really only deal with items, which is fine it's a good way to learn how things work, but where am i supposed to put a script?

the mod i'm trying to make is just solely a script, but i don't know where to put it
i'm assuming `MyMod/scripts` but should it go in `3_game`, `4_world`, or `5_mission`?
i would assume `3_game` but the chat is handled through `P:/scripts/5_mission/gui/chat/chat.c`, so that inclines me to believe it should be in `5_mission`?
for context if you don't know, i'm trying to create a script that spawns an item on a user that typed a chat command, and man i'm so confused
i've tried looking around and searching things but really all i found was the rpc i can use which is great info, if i knew where to put that.

i have a script in `MyMod/scripts/5_mission/spawncommand/spawncommand.c`
in my config.cpp, do i just put `""Mission""` in `dependencies[] = {}` and then uncomment the class `missionScriptModule` in the class `defs`?
again, im inclined to believe that's how you're supposed to do this but honestly at this point this has been so unintuitive that i wouldn't doubt it if i was wrong.

also, another thing that was never explained to me: how do i initialize the script through config.cpp or is that done by the aforementioned `missionScriptModule` class?

again i hate that i have to waste your time on this shit but i have no alternative

it's pretty cool that all the wiki cares to explain about the dependencies array is the comment `optional, when you need to set class dependency`, there's nothing on what it does or why it just tells you that you need it if you need it

you're gonna hate me for this one, because it probably has a very obvious answer but this is why humans need sleep🤷

when i run the script on the server, it says the print is an unexpected statement when loading the mission file
i tried adding `Game` to both the dependencies and required addons in the config, and also uncommented gameScriptModule under defs just to be sure, and yeah nothing

hate to waste an actual person's time with this question, but how do i get items to have actions?
like, i have a syringe that's supposed to make someone black out, but how do i actually make it do that?
rooting through the game's code, i found out how the epinephrine injector works

`epinephrine.c`
```class Epinephrine: Inventory_Base
{
    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();
        
        AddAction(ActionInjectEpinephrineTarget);
        AddAction(ActionInjectEpinephrineSelf);
    }
    
    override void OnApply(PlayerBase player)
    {
        if( player.GetModifiersManager().IsModifierActive(eModifiers.MDF_EPINEPHRINE ) )//effectively resets the timer
        {
            player.GetModifiersManager().DeactivateModifier( eModifiers.MDF_EPINEPHRINE );
        }
        player.GetModifiersManager().ActivateModifier( eModifiers.MDF_EPINEPHRINE );
    }
};
```

but i don't know how to integrate this into my own syringe.
i have my item's class in `config.cpp` with the derived class `Inventory_Base` (and i stole the code for the clear syringe), but i can't stick the above code in it otherwise i'll get this error when i build the addon: `File P:\Tranquilizer\config.cpp, line 80: '/CfgVehicles/TranqSyringe.override': 'v' encountered instead of '='`

so, i instead decided to do it like the epinephrine and stick the logic for the syringe into a separate file, which i placed in `Tranquilizer/data/tranquilizer.c`, and stuck the aforementioned epinephrine code inside, but changed it to be what i needed it to be, and when i hold it out in-game i don't get the option to inject myself..

`tranquilizer.c`
```class TranqSyringe : Inventory_Base
{
    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();

        AddAction(ActionInjectEpinephrineTarget);
        AddAction(ActionInjectEpinephrineSelf);
    }

    override void OnApply(PlayerBase player)
    {
        player.AddHealth("""", ""Shock"", 0);
    }
};
