234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 4:57 AM,how can i change the spawn/disconnect timer? default seems to be 15 seconds is it part of the Server.cfg ?,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 4:59 AM,@Danny 🌭 i meant that if you spawn an item you refer to it with a string. so there is no autocomplete or anything. just a simple enum with the corresponding value would have been enough. Right now you have to look everything up and you can misspell item names easily,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 4:59 AM,"for example player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInInventory(""AKM""); should be something like player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInInventory(Weapons.AKM);",,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 5:00 AM,so you can use a. autocompletion and b. get compile time errors,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/02/2019 5:00 AM,True,,
466716793306873867,bangaladore,01/02/2019 5:01 AM,"@Langeweilezug compile time errors suck as right now launching the game with the mod seems to be the only way to compile the mod and receive errors. Some people say they know how to compile with workbench, but everything I've tried, it always successfully compiles the script and doesn't really care.",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/02/2019 5:02 AM,DannyDog has figured something out but it is way to confusing to even set up properly that I doubt it even is the right way.,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/02/2019 5:02 AM,and enum's won't work @Langeweilezug due to how object defining works,,
466716793306873867,bangaladore,01/02/2019 5:03 AM,"@Jacob_Mango another issue is that to do proper compile time errors, you need to tell the workbench what mods should be loaded. Not sure if workbench supports that rn.",,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 5:04 AM,Well i dont really know much about DayZ Modding and the whole ecosystem but this is just something that strikes me as being very odd,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/02/2019 5:05 AM,Now that there are ppl in this chat can someone quickly tell me how to change the spawn/disconnect timer? i know the scripting channel is probably not the right place,,
