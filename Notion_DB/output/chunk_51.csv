148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/11/2020 10:49 AM,It deletes it from clients. Not from the server,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:49 AM,e.g. i made a trash can where i used ObjectDelete and that fked up things cause it shuffled inventorylocation,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:49 AM,whereas if i used just Delete() it wasn't fkin up inventorylocation,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/11/2020 10:49 AM,Ah yeah ok they're different the helk,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/11/2020 10:49 AM,Good to know,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:50 AM,i think it might just help with synching stuff,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:50 AM,they also added a DeleteOnClient,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:50 AM,which i haven't been able to fully test,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/11/2020 10:50 AM,Yeah dunno what deleteonclient does yet. Haven't checked and I don't recall it being used or anyone asking for it,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:50 AM,i tried using it for my snowball,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:52 AM,Only place @Jacob_Mango its in an inject action,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,03/11/2020 10:53 AM,Ah so it's a method you call on the client (duh) to delete it. Kinda seems like that'll result in weird synch issues tho.,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:54 AM,i've learned a lot more in the last few weeks about client/server stuff. still a bit fuzzy on the edges,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:54 AM,i never really checked client side logs when testing a mod,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:54 AM,now i make sure i do,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:55 AM,@Jacob_Mango Its prob used to avoid delays in object deletion which end up causing desync,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:55 AM,"As in, once the action is done, dont want for server to delete it...get rid of it on client so there is no chance of desync",,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,03/11/2020 10:56 AM,@Jacob_Mango i think it's also to ensure deletion. kinda like call delete on server onfinish kind of thing and if on client it's still there DELETE IT,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:56 AM,"I think its a ""ditched"" feature lol, or at least they use it with actions that are instant",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:56 AM,The inject action is somewhat instant,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/11/2020 10:56 AM,It has no action wheel thingy,,

Why do I want to do this:

For example, there will be a mod that I will write, but I do not want it to be merged and used by everyone, for this I will transfer part of the functionality to the server, so that the mod would not work without the server side of the script.
