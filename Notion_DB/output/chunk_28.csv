298947607730978816,Mezu#7499,04/05/2019 5:50 PM,it is default without mod skrinshoot,,
298947607730978816,Mezu#7499,04/05/2019 5:50 PM,so i need to find some proxy for this model in cfg vehicle,,

230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 5:51 PM,as they are binarized models,,

298947607730978816,Mezu#7499,04/05/2019 5:52 PM,so then i need create a new action for  nearobject and closed default action for forwad side?,,

If you want to switch projects you need to edit it again.

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 7:22 PM,you shall get it. But here is a simple task you can do to see how it works out: Create a mod that just overrides any class or adds any instance of a custom class and get the debugger to break on it,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 7:22 PM,In a way that if you were to  work on a different project you could just switch it to like you would do in VS,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 7:49 PM,I think what he might do in the background is downcasting the playerbase instance from the modded version back to the vanilla one but implicitly which causes the warning?,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 7:59 PM,It must not contain casting explicitly. As soon as a class returns it own type it will create an implict cast i am am not wrong,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/05/2019 8:11 PM,it would be nice to see it squashed,,

230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:12 PM,Or is it that the internal tools/way of doing things is different to the way we do it,,

102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:16 PM,No supression as far as Im aware,,

102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:20 PM,although in this case the modded part isnt in the repro steps cleetus provided,,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:20 PM,so probably just done it step by step and it didnt pop,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:21 PM,"well now thats sorted. I am sure this will happen on the internal build as well, as its an issue with enscript and not dayz speficially",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/05/2019 8:23 PM,"I think if the source of the suppression is found, it may help with internal debugging even. When something unknown is preventing something a majority outside can reproduce, who knows what other things it's doing 😛",,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:23 PM,defeats the point of warnings if they arent real,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:23 PM,same as the surivorgames stuff there,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:24 PM,can be fixed by like one #ifdef debug,,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:24 PM,"@Cleetus  arkensor is most likely right on this one, its not suppression but non-errors being generated by the modded class interaction with the vanilla class",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/05/2019 8:24 PM,ah k,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:25 PM,I mean I see why it happens... As modded keyword just extends off the base class and replaces default instance,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:25 PM,But it's just annoying as it shows nothing,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:25 PM,"So, how does the modded class even, i guess, ``work``, does it just do something like ``modded : base``",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:25 PM,"like, the parent is the base so it inherits everything",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:25 PM,with the child having the same name,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:26 PM,"which is usually a nogo, but intended in this case",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:26 PM,Modded playerBase is basically just playerbase#2 :: playerBase,,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:26 PM,"not exactly but kind of, is what we are told",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:27 PM,the real fun is when to mods try to mod one game class. according to @rVn it results in mod1 : base -> mod2 : mod1,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:27 PM,when calling super each time it should not cause issues,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:27 PM,did i get that correctly @rVn ?,,
102121607417327616,rvn,04/05/2019 8:27 PM,yes,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:28 PM,okay we just need to make sure to teach all modders to always call super. first to make their stuff compatible,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:28 PM,I mean sometimes you don't want to do it,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,04/05/2019 8:28 PM,not sure what dediceds over the load order though,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:29 PM,I'd imagine it'd be the requiredAddons,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:29 PM,RequiredAddons - mod param,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:29 PM,since that dictates the PBO launch order,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,04/05/2019 8:29 PM,"from everything I tested, it was the order in the -mod= launch order, but I could be totally wrong",,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,04/05/2019 8:29 PM,Only thing that defers it is requiredaddons,,

230061386888118273,.thurston,04/05/2019 8:33 PM,then you'd need to load ``mod`` first,,

I'm adding ingredients from a map<string, array<int>>, the key is the ingredient type (""Hatchet"" for example). I loop through the keys using map.GetKey(index) and add the keys as ingredients. I also print out the ingredients I've just added and it prints everything correctly. It works perfectly fine if you add them like I did at the bottom with ""Hatchet"", but not from the map.

```
        for (int i = 0; i < map.Count(); i++) {
            string key = map.GetKey(i);
            InsertIngredient(1, key);

214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:30 AM,I can get some sample code for that if you need it for your own project?,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:30 AM,Im in class now.,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,04/19/2019 1:34 AM,"I have trouble getting my pack selection working, was hoping you might have an idea",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:36 AM,I can send you code that will place the tent instead of the pack when you go to place it ingame,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,04/19/2019 1:36 AM,"Yeah I got that working, I just cant pack it up",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:36 AM,its based on my ladders but works the same for any model,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:36 AM,awww,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:37 AM,Its the same thing but reversed,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:37 AM,So when you pick it up you want an action that gives you the other object instead,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:37 AM,so its the opposite of placement,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,04/19/2019 1:38 AM,"Yeah I understand how it should work, its just I dont get the option ot pack it, I assume im doing view geo wrong",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:38 AM,"Mmmm, have you tried asking the guys who made sneaky stashes for help?",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:38 AM,They have tents,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/19/2019 1:44 AM,"so pre 1.01 update our sneaky tents packed like normal tents but once they added the new selection for packing (stupid bag on the ground hitbox that seems to always get clipped into things). since we were using the unfinished models (or due to our skill level) we were no longer able to pack so we came up with a janky solution using a crafting recipe knife+tent= packed up tent (requires tool to pack).  now assuming that that is not what you guys would want, I would look into copying that bag on the ground in your tent (not literally the image of the bag, but the selection and how its configured in the model.cfg /config)  and in terms of the open close thing im pretty sure its just two different selections like entranceO entranceC kinda thing and you can use the same exact actions copied from medium tent config wise. its been a hot minute since ive been in the scripts for that stuff so im gonna take a peak too incase im forgetting some piece. Idk that I would be able to help but if you guys hit a wall i'd gladly take a swing at it",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/19/2019 1:45 AM,also I dont think it would help at the stage you guys are at now with your tents but if any of that code is ever useful by all means do what you will with it,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:48 AM,@Deleted User  Right now all I have is a tent with a collision box in geo and a seperate door in 1.0 and door hitbox in geo. I have my model.cfg setup and I am now starting to think about how I am going to get the door to open and close. If you know how to help me with the open/close please pm me !,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:48 AM,I have a good idea of how to do the packing.,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:49 AM,@Not A Banana  If my packing method does happen to work I will send the code and configs your way. Use them however you see fit,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/19/2019 1:51 AM,"sounds good aeryes, im gonna make some dinner and stuff but ill hit you up with any useful info I have (kinda wanna make a mock up now just to experience it all). Have you watched the door tutorial? I think its overkill in the way that you dont need a door ""animation"" as much as a toggle between two states but it may also bear some fruit for you. worst case scenario I bet hennessy could get you sorted",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,04/19/2019 1:53 AM,@Deleted User Your talking about deanos one right? I have it on my list but havent gotten to it yet.  I just need to find a way to make my selections vanish,,➕ (1)

456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/19/2019 2:02 AM,"so model cfg copy of those selections, the existence of those selections on your model (or equivalent with different name), that portion of the tent script (parent off of tentbase) and then the actions/format from the normal config should work in theory",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,04/19/2019 2:03 AM,is their a piece of that that you don't have? try adding all that and let me know if it doesnt work after or if it doesnt make sense on one of the parts,,
