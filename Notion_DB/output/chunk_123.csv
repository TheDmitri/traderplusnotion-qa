604504291440328746,c_matthews00,05/18/2022 6:37 AM,I’m looking to write a mod to make vanilla wooden crates and barrels invisible while placing. Anyone have any tips on where to start?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,05/18/2022 7:09 AM,Maybe change the texture of the hologram?,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,05/18/2022 7:45 AM,"I'm confused. Isn't ObjectDelete a void? Why is it in a if statement? Plus why is a return inside the if check parenthesis? I haven't tested, but you may could do,
```c
override void EEDelete( EntityAI parent )
{
    Explosion_Sound();

    super.EEDelete( parent );
}
```

If you stick that inside your custom item script it should work. However if you were to stick that inside of simply ItemBase or such it would start spamming explosion sounds when any item is deleted. I'm sure I'm wrong since as I said I haven't tested. I'm sure Zedmag or someone will probably correct me.",,

173448803578281984,inkihh,05/18/2022 12:35 PM,I'd like to ask them if I may extract the 7 segment display bit and use it for a generic Stopwatch mod that other modders could use,,
218413499947155456,steve_aka_salutesh,05/18/2022 12:37 PM,You mean the UI that gets displayed on the top?,,

173448803578281984,inkihh,05/18/2022 12:38 PM,top right corner probably,,
218413499947155456,steve_aka_salutesh,05/18/2022 12:38 PM,I can offer you that you can use the one from the expansion Navigation mod,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,05/18/2022 12:39 PM,oh ok,,
218413499947155456,steve_aka_salutesh,05/18/2022 12:39 PM,At the end it's just a image. If you need the PSD file i can send it to you when i am back from work,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,05/18/2022 12:39 PM,it's also the 7 segment display logic,,

173448803578281984,inkihh,05/18/2022 12:42 PM,that's a neat idea,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 2:30 PM,So question? Why would a ```modded class MissionServer``` affect someone elses ```modded class MissionServer``` and non of the same functions are colliding,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 2:31 PM,"For example, you have a missionServer.c and it overrides OnMissionStart and stuff but its a modded class missionserver",,

158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 2:34 PM,Pretty much affecting dr jones trader from opening if another mod uses modded class MissionServer,,

278102625877098497,vliek,05/18/2022 2:47 PM,Same height as what I entered in the vector,,

258678517955297283,smaccmodding,05/18/2022 3:18 PM,"If you add things like vars within MissionServer they would be accessable to both. If both mods declared the same named vars there would be an error given most likely.

If you open a class/function whatever they are, inside of MissionServer and it's overriding an existing statement then it will only run the code within yours and disregard everyone else's. This is dependent on load order tho, as someone else doing the same could override everything in yours.

If you didn't want to override other code but simple just add too you can call the super of the function which will load the other code from this function first, then the new code you included below. 

This can be fucked by someone in another mod not including super in a function you want to edit which I believe there are no good ways to work around cept overriding it yourself and copying there code into your code for that function. Be safe and leave comments/links to there mod there to show no intent of thief simple just bug fixing.

This might all be jibberish so let me know xD",,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 3:19 PM,@SMACC Its very odd,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 3:19 PM,So if you look at trader missionserver,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 3:19 PM,It uses nothing about OnMissionStart,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 3:19 PM,And uses modded class missionserver,,
158031412413464576,callatic,05/18/2022 3:19 PM,So I have my own missionserver.c,,

Not supposed to be like on rearmed where it is done for raiding. It’s more for a ww2 server, where placeable sand bag barricades etc can be destroyed with rpg‘s.",,

You then only need to include the stuff to change the sounds.

Then you'd want to do more like, `class MyWreck_Police extends CrashBaseNew` which will give you a new wreck. Remember you'll also need to do the CPP side of this to make the duplicate model and the likes. In CPP land you can probably do `class MyWreck_Police extends Wreck_Police` as the front end stuff will mainly be the same

Let me know if this makes any sense",,

Generally speaking I have been using the 'Community Offline Mode' to test my scripts and mods offline. Recently I've tried to deploy a ""FishNetTrap"" (fresh water trap) and after doing so, I could no longer put anything into my character's hands, and the trap doesn't look inflated like it should be (compared that to online servers..)

So basically I have two questions 
1. Is there an other way to quickly test mods in an offline way? (obviously would still like to have teleportation tools, object spawning etc)
2. Is anyone familiar with the issue and has an idea of fixing it?",,

Basically my mod does not load.

```

class CfgPatches
{
    class MainServerMod
    {
        requiredAddons[]=
        {
            // """"
        };
    };
};

class CfgMods
{
    class MainServerMod
    {
        type = ""mod"";

        class defs
        {
            class worldScriptModule
            {
                value = """";
                files[] = {""scripts/4_World""};
            };
        };
    };
};

```

The prefix is scripts

I also tried MainServerMod/scripts/4_World
and just 4_World

Also tried MainServerMod/scripts as prefix

```
moddded class PlayerBase
{
    override void OnJumpStart()    // overriding an existing method
    {
        super.OnJumpStart();            // call the original jump callback method so we don't break stuff
        Write_Log(""Jump"");    // our modded print
    };
    
    override void EEKilled( Object killer )
    {
        
        Print(""EEKilled, you have died"");

        SurvivorBase sbKilled = this;
            if (killer.IsMan())

            {

            Man manKiller = Man.Cast(killer);

            if (sbKilled.GetPlayerIdentityName() == manKiller.GetIdentity().GetName()) { // suicide
                GetGame().ChatPlayer(0,sbKilled.GetPlayerIdentityName() + "" took the easy way out"");
            }

            else { // kill

                PlayerBase playerKiller = PlayerBase.Cast(killer);
                //playerKiller.KillCount++;
                //string kill_count = string.ToString(playerKiller.KillCount)
                //string kill_count_message = ""(KS: "" + kill_count + "")"";

                GetGame().ChatPlayer(0, sbKilled.GetPlayerIdentityName() + "" "" + ""got smoked by"" + "" "" + manKiller.GetIdentity().GetName()/* + kill_count_message*/);


            }

            } else { // random death
                GetGame().ChatPlayer(0,sbKilled.GetPlayerIdentityName() + "" "" + ""died"");
            
            }
        
        super.EEKilled( killer );
    };
};

536921929932603412,xamy9000,06/09/2022 4:26 PM,i don't think you need to add a prefix if scripts folder is inside the root folder of your addon,,
