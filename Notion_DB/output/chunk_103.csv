I tried to give players the option to refill filters in a more pleasing way then the workshop mod offers. I am trying to make refilling filters an action like refilling water bottles. Since both water bottle and filters have liquid in its config, i thought that would be a nice way of doing it. As expected didnt work. 

I registered a new action for gas mask filter

```modded class GasMask_Filter extends ItemBase
{
    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();
        
        AddAction(ActionTransferFilter);    
    }
};```

Then i copy pasted vanilla transfer liquid action and changed what i thought was necessary to make it work with filters. Also added AnimEvents from water bottle to filters in config.cpp. Can someone take a look and give me a hint in the right direction?",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/900831511106969610/ActionTransferFilter.c,

272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 4:57 AM,then just bad luck,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 4:58 AM,There is no other way to reliably do it unless the modder itself does the dta one,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 4:58 AM,Otherwise it wil lkinda be by chance depending on the mods loaded and how big your mod that uses it is,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 4:58 AM,and the name and directory of the files,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 4:59 AM,Best way to solve this issue is just letting people know about the dta folder,,

696983057114333195,mrt101,10/24/2021 5:00 AM,why does the size matter? requiredAddons is supposed to fully load the scripts from the mods you put there before the current mod,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:00 AM,not the case,,

272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:00 AM,That's why it is such a huge issue with defines,,

272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:01 AM,"idk, main issue is the unreadability",,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:02 AM,We know that big mods cause issues because of how many issues people had had with expansion defines,,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:03 AM,Just note,,
696983057114333195,mrt101,10/24/2021 5:03 AM,"hmm, ok thanks, i'll just do it this way for now and if someone has a problem later, i'll ask the other mod author to do the dta thing, also i will use dta from now on",,
272245679013888011,marioe,10/24/2021 5:03 AM,It seems to be a problem with defines only,,

Synchronized variables are part of system that was designed for efficient synchronization of game entity's scripted **state**. This state must be as small as possible. When client needs some more larger data, it has to ask for them throught RPC call only when it needs them.

Sound is literally just an effect that in most cases is just a reaction to an event.",,

The script works, when shooting a zombie the blablabla is applied to the player shooting, however the short range distance check doesn't, it gets applied also if I shoot from 100 meters away.
Also tried with if ( vector.Distance( player.GetPosition(), this.GetPosition() ) < 5 ); but no effect.

i was wondering if someone would be able to point my inexperienced ass in the right direction. I am trying to bring the KeyCard-Rooms mod to Namalsk. Repacking the mod and running it as is works as intended, but having static objects spawn in where i dont want them. Removing all the static item spawns lets the mod run. but upon interacting with the door, now the loot chest wont spawn. I dont need those static items at all and would love it if they didnt spawn, or can i move them all to the corner or the map ?
Any help is appreciated !",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/903990236722397184/Before.c,
