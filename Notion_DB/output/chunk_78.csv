Workbench/Script + DayZDiag; pointing DayZ to the packed mod and launching it with -filepatching; source mod folder structure is linked in the folder with the executable; Workbench launched pointing to the source mod. Script editor shows my mod scripts and the output pane shows anything I print out from the mod; I can set/step/etc breakpoints. Build Scripts works fine, no errors/warnings. Everything seems good until I try to recompile on host, then it gives variations of the following. I've tried a few different scripts, both World and Mission (and set as such in the mod) - even tried some of the DayZ scripts just to see what would happen. No matter which I try, I get some variation of the following error. I've had this working before, so it's about driving me nuts. ```SCRIPT       : ScriptDebugger: remote re-compilation was successful.

135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 7:31 PM,scaling survivors is a pain tho. you need to do it in EOnPostFrame,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:31 PM,i am trying scale another pain - vehicle üòõ,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:33 PM,"ok, I will try, thx for hint üôÇ",,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:35 PM,but why game reset scale  to 1 when I set for example on init that object should have different scale?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:38 PM,"If you need to reset the scale when the object enters your network bubble, why not do it on EOnInit? Or have a method is is called after the constructor",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:40 PM,"Or have a net sync integer, that keeps track of the scale, and resets the scale when the variables get synced to the client",,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 7:40 PM,net sync doesnt work on buildings,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:40 PM,but he's not talking about a building,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:43 PM,even if you can't use net sync on buildings you can create a class that manages scaling for objects that don't accept networking like rpcs or net synced variables,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 7:45 PM,"you wouldnt want a netsync variable on a building anyway. unless you used it very sparingly, considering how many buildings their are and that people are loading. its alot of extra sync work to do",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:53 PM,anyways.... @Hunterz what happens if you change the position or orientation of a *scaled* object?,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:53 PM,its moved to this position or orientation,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:54 PM,it doesn't change it's scale back to normal?,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:54 PM,its still not working for me perfect,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/18/2021 7:55 PM,testing now with postframe,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:57 PM,you'd be better off using `EOnPostSimulate` than post frame for vehicles,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/18/2021 7:58 PM,otherwise you'd be calling set tranform every frame even if the vehicle hasn't moved,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 8:47 PM,you are changing the scale after the physics calculation is done,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 8:47 PM,so visually it changes,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,02/18/2021 8:47 PM,but the physics dont actually update on the server,,

Problem:
So as far as I know, the Print function uses caching (if that is how it is called) and doesn't print immediately when it is called, that is why my print in PlayerDisconnected returns an error as the player variable no longer exists when it is needed.

Possible solution:
Save the player variable in a way where you duplicate it into a new variable. But how would I do that?",,
