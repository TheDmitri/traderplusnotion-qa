239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 8:58 PM,All I’m gonna say is that DayZ is shit at sound effects played by server,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 8:58 PM,So use RPC functions to play sounds for on server to client,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,12/10/2018 8:58 PM,thats a really bad way,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 8:58 PM,"Place the sound trigger on server, depending on what, where and why. From there send a request to the client to play sound",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 8:59 PM,Well it’s the same as play sound loop but you are only making it work faster. That function still pings the clients to do loops,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:00 PM,Pretty sure the delay is something to do with that or I’m missing on something here,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:01 PM,Why is it a bad way? Sending like 4kb of info to request to play sound every 4-8 seconds ( depending on your audio length) heck you could even send the trigger once. To keep playing and then once another trigger is hit to stop plying,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:01 PM,So the loop part can be skipped.,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:02 PM,"There’s many ways to do this, you could event make a script that auto plays the sound on vehicle locally. Kinda like heli crash with its smoke",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:03 PM,"The smoke inits in object creation due to its class being active, you could do that with the wreck model, add a bool that you can control via server and or add a CTX save param that controls when to stop or start stop",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/10/2018 9:04 PM,HECK you could even make it loop locally to stop playing sound if plane is on the ground/airdrop is successful by check air to ground distance,,

I thought it is possible in Dayz to use sql queries to interact with DB, but I think I was wrong (I need confirmation here).
So I went through DayZ code and found out that devs use OnStoreXXX(ParamsWriteContext ctx) function to interact with DB, had anyone else experience using it?
Also went through Kegan's BattleRoyal code and saw he use json for persistence purposes.

So anyone experienced, please suggest what to use as persistence storage?",,
