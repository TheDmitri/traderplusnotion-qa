A type is a container for data. Different types can hold different things.  A string type variable contains...well...a string.  A float contains a decimal number within a certain range. An int is a primative type that can contain a __whole number__ from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. I'm not sure that enforce even has a double primitive type but generally a double can contain a much larger range of values by virtue of the fact that more memory is allocated to it.

When you declare via config.cpp file something like

void myItem()

```myItem.Type() = myItem not chair.```

I wrote a tool in powershell (so I'm not expecting anyone to look at the code specifically) that manages the workflow for mod development.  It'll create a mod from template, build, launch and a few other simple things.  The idea is to make it easier for new modders to get up and running and even to streamline the process a bit for more experienced modders. It works as expected __EXCEPT__ that hot loading will only work if the mod is called FirstMod.  As FirstMod is my go to tutorial modname, my first thought is that I had that name hardcoded somewhere in my code and just forgot to take it out. Except I can't find it by eyeball or using notepad++ to search in files. I completely uninstalled dayz and tools, deleted and reextracted P: just to make sure that its not in some left over bit.  I've checked the gproj in dayz, workbench, and for the mod itself. I've checked the code that builds, links, and launches by hand and with notepad++.  Any ideas or strategies how I can track down this bug.  The tool itself is otherwise ready to share and is pretty cool but I can't release it until I track this bug down.  Here is a demo of the tool and the bug. Any thought no matter how crazy would be appreciated. <https://youtu.be/jmcnu6UUIMc>",,

A tunnel system was mapped and the trigger is below the tunnel, but the ""Y"" also goes up above the tunnel, so players are still within the trigger radius. Therefore it covers everything and works as intended. (when people ""teleport"" in there that is)

The only problem is when people log off n back in, there's no trigger for night, even though they are in the area where the night should trigger. Hopefully that wasn't too confusing!

585892620706775079,boomlay,12/20/2022 9:10 PM,"Well... that's what I thought too.

But there is only `if ( !hasRootAsPlayer )` in the vanilla function and no `else`

So I made this:
```override void ProcessItemTemperature( float delta, bool hasParent, bool hasRootAsPlayer, ItemBase refParentIB )
    {
        if (!hasRootAsPlayer)
        {
            AddTemperature( delta * -0.01 );
        }
        else
        {
            AddTemperature( delta * -0.001 );
        }
    }```

But it lost temperature much (very much) faster in the hand than on the floor. 🤷",,

I would like to request a bit of help over here
I have a deathmatch server and I`ve been experiencing lots of Dayz clients crashing from time to time
Server does not crash and even doesn`t have a crash log file

I already requested some players to send me their crash/script/RPT files and the error messages are very different from one another
Anyone could give a direction on what should be the best approach on trying to solve this?",,

384850738355896321,ragtyson,12/22/2022 6:42 AM,so it was just shift+d,,
384850738355896321,ragtyson,12/22/2022 6:42 AM,at this point,,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 1:41 PM,I had it working pretty well for lists with 30+ items,,
196845794513518592,shaggoth,12/22/2022 1:43 PM,so small chance for whole preset and 1.0 for every item?,,
244647583576883200,valdark2,12/22/2022 2:20 PM,It think he means if you add all the chances for every item the total is 1.0,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 3:21 PM,No the chance for the preset determines the chance to select the preset itself. And then all items in the preset should have a total sum of 1.0,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 3:21 PM,With those having higher chance than other tend to be further down in the list,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 3:22 PM,It feels like the game simply performs a dice roll on each item going though it one by one and checking if the chance matches - in as is smaller equal,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 3:22 PM,And stops once it found one where it matched,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,12/22/2022 3:23 PM,So if you end up with high chances in the first palces the chance for the later ones is effectively decreased since it has a higher chance to succeed on the first ones already,,

I got an AI to write this for me but need help to implement it.

This plugin will be loaded by L3DT when it starts up. When the on_load function is called, the plugin will get the current map and get the texture layer from the map.
It will then create a new layer to represent the roads and fill it with a height of 0. Next,
it will iterate over all the pixels in the texture layer and check if the current pixel is a road (represented by the colour 0xFF0000 in this example).
If it is a road, the plugin will set the height at that coordinate to 0 on the road layer. Finally, it will save the modified map to a file.

This is just a simple example to demonstrate how to use the L3DT API to access and modify layers in a map based on a texture layer.
You can find more information about the L3DT API and the various functions and classes that are available in the L3DT documentation.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1055565036510261278/Roads-CutFill-Via-ColourPath.cpp,

Moved the check for `theName != theText` to the beginning of the `if` statement. This avoids unnecessary comparisons if the names are already different.
Removed the unnecessary nested `if` statement and combined the conditions into a single `if` statement. This reduces indentation and makes the code easier to read.
I hope these changes help improve the performance and readability of the code. As always, it's important to thoroughly test any changes to make sure that they work as intended and don't ```",,

That script basically hides a texture, so if the bag has nothing in the slot a texture is invisible, if something is in it then the texture is shown. these are all new spawn bags via types so all should have nothing in that slot.

941653443200839681,priv2221,12/25/2022 4:18 PM,"It is possible to respawn zombie AI after a restart, but it will depend on the specific game and its mechanics. Some games may have built-in functionality for respawning certain types of AI or objects after a restart, while others may not.

To respawn zombie AI in a game, you may need to use a mod or script that adds this functionality. You could also try modifying the game's code or using a tool such as a trainer to manipulate the game's state and respawn the zombie AI.

It's important to note that modifying a game's code or using third-party tools to alter its behavior can be complex and may be against the terms of service for the game. In addition, it could cause issues with the game, such as bugs or other unintended consequences.

If you are interested in respawning zombie AI in a specific game and are not sure how to do it, you may want to consult the game's community or forums for guidance. There may be other players who have experience with this and can offer guidance or suggest resources that could help.",,

if using GetGame().GetCallQueue(CALL_CATEGORY_GUI).CallLater(DropPlayer, 10000, false, player); with various delays is the correct approach,
is this even doable on client side?
