94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,That is kinda what I was thinking,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,But with AddChild do you just have it in cargo?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,Or is there a universal slot that all those addChild objects have?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/16/2022 5:19 AM,no. AddChild is free rein with a few side effects. Like wonky physics when overlapping geos happen. And camera blocking. But what do you want to do exactly?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:20 AM,I am wanting to use a display case to display multiple armbands,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:21 AM,I'd like to eventually be able to place any item (within reason) in the display case. [Barring any major rotational problems],,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:21 AM,I've seen some mods with shelves in the workshop but wasn't sure how much hard coding they had,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/16/2022 5:21 AM,Well… think about this for a second… WHAT in game allows almost ANYTHING to be attached to?,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:22 AM,I apologies for my slowness haha,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:22 AM,"How does that help? Can I have multiple ""hands"" slots?",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/16/2022 5:22 AM,maybe? 🤷‍♂️,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:23 AM,"Haha, gotcha",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/16/2022 5:23 AM,I’ve never tried using the ‘hand’ slot for anything. Haha.,,

144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:47 PM,"add energy manager to the config, then put what everyou want the item to do inside of onworkstart or onwork",,

144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:52 PM,depends if you just need the item to have a battery and don't care about it being used or anything like that you could just bool a check to see if a 9v is attached,,
144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:52 PM,otherwise just copypasta from the torch and play with the values till you get a energy usages you like,,
213272428154060800,muer,04/16/2022 2:53 PM,"Might have a look at the torch then. I personally don't mind the lack of a battery, as the default config allows only 2 uses out of the item, but since it's a continuous action consuming half the health, playing with battery requirements might make things interesting",,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 3:21 PM,"So I've moved on trying to adjust .xml files only finding that bohemia messed up when defining their own config values and now find myself looking through .pbo files to see if I can firstly find dynamic toxic zones and then see if I can alter dynamic toxic zones & finally add new dynamic toxic zones with custom ranges given the range is the thing that does not work for them currently.

So, for this kind of modding, am I in the right channel and if so am I correct by looking & trying to adjust .pbo files where-after I plan to upload the modded versions to the workshop?

The only reference I could find is

```
    class ContaminatedArea_Static: EffectArea
    {
        scope = 2;
    };
    class ContaminatedArea_Dynamic: EffectArea
    {
        scope = 2;
    };

in config.cpp so I have no clue how to proceed from here",,
213272428154060800,muer,04/16/2022 3:42 PM,@TheAdmiral mind if I dm you a few questions about the battery thing? (and sorry for the ping if you don't appreciate that),,
144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 3:47 PM,sure shoot me a question,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 3:58 PM,Guess that makes 3 now 😛 I look forward to seeing you answer questions about it in the future 😛,,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 4:16 PM,"So I did a search all for contaminatedArea_Dynamic and managed to stumble upon this and see it's worth for what I am trying to do:
( Original post by TheAdmiral on how to add toxic grenades)
```
class M18SmokeGrenade_Red_Contaminated extends M18SmokeGrenade_Red
{
    override void OnWorkStop()
    {
        super.OnWorkStop();
        
        if ( GetGame().IsServer() )
            GetGame().GetCEApi().SpawnGroup( ""ContaminatedArea_Dynamic"", GetPosition() );
    }
}
```

But then instead of a grenade I would make a new class ContaminatedArea_Radius100 extends ContaminatedArea_Dynamic All I need is to alter the radius of the area from 75 to 100. (I plan on making several different sized area's too)

So yeah I'm basically just using discord search to get to this point given I couldnt find even a bit of documentation on scripting (Including the channel's pinned items, or I must've looked over it)",,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 4:18 PM,The only place next I could think of is arma2 scripting tutorials but then again contaminated gas zones are dayz exclusive so I doubt I would find any radius definitions there,,
397607224744083457,cygnusaurus,04/16/2022 4:41 PM,What is the difference between OnStartServer and OnExecuteServer?,,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 4:45 PM,"I think OnExecuteServer is when the server Executes something versus OnExecuteClient where something is executed on the client.

OnStartServer is when the server is starting (But don't quote me on this lol, I've been only diving into DayZ scripting since about 2 hours ago)",,
627088045148995605,autoh777,04/16/2022 4:46 PM,https://prnt.sc/JB8hNrr-Cad_ does anyone knows how I can make that the Ironsight is gone when I attach an optic. (I mean not when you are in the scope),,

But otherwise, the server is running a bunch more scripts that are not needed by the client (client has full functionality without it)",,

GetRPCManager().SendRPC(""MyMod"", ""SynchronizeObject"", new Param1<Apple>(this.apple), true, sender, target);

561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:10 PM,Because the object is outside the player’s network range,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:11 PM,so even RPCing doesn't allow you to send an object...,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:11 PM,dang,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:11 PM,in that case i was wasting time,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:11 PM,well...the only thing i can do is RPC a vector to its position,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:11 PM,"When sending world objects over RPC, you’re just sending a “pointer”",,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:12 PM,and that pointer is null on client side until the object is made (rendered in the bubble),,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:12 PM,that sucks...but sending more than the pointer would be unnecessary traffic in most cases,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:13 PM,What are you trying to do exactly? There’s plenty of ways to network data,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:13 PM,well sending a vector with position would be enough,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:13 PM,basically,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:13 PM,i'm just trying to get ref. to it so i can slap a nice 3d marker on it 😛,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:14 PM,You’d have to update on an interval just incase the object moves when outside network range,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:15 PM,i'm doing it on 10ms even in the current implementation with the marker just using a target entity to track it by itself,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:16 PM,if that target entity is replaced by a vector than the marker will have to be updated by the entity it' tracking instead,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:16 PM,"Once it’s within client network range, you can then use the client to smoothly update the object’s UI position",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:16 PM,since it wouldn't have a reference to it,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:17 PM,"once within the network range i guess you could use the update method, right?",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:17 PM,or is there a better way,,

Try doing like action_data.m_Player.SetHealth(0); or some shit so you know the modified code is working. I know fucked method but its normally works
Once you know it works it should be as simple as in the final or maybe even ActionConditionContinue call the function to remove the fuel (Function created in Land_fuel thinggy) to remove the fuel for the last ""pump""

Afterwords just a check in here ActionCondition and here ActionConditionContinue for if the pump has fuel to kill the action mid thinggy if it runs out
