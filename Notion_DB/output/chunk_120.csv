94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,That is kinda what I was thinking,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,But with AddChild do you just have it in cargo?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:18 AM,Or is there a universal slot that all those addChild objects have?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/16/2022 5:19 AM,no. AddChild is free rein with a few side effects. Like wonky physics when overlapping geos happen. And camera blocking. But what do you want to do exactly?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 5:20 AM,I am wanting to use a display case to display multiple armbands,,

144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:47 PM,"add energy manager to the config, then put what everyou want the item to do inside of onworkstart or onwork",,

144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:52 PM,depends if you just need the item to have a battery and don't care about it being used or anything like that you could just bool a check to see if a 9v is attached,,
144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 2:52 PM,otherwise just copypasta from the torch and play with the values till you get a energy usages you like,,
213272428154060800,muer,04/16/2022 2:53 PM,"Might have a look at the torch then. I personally don't mind the lack of a battery, as the default config allows only 2 uses out of the item, but since it's a continuous action consuming half the health, playing with battery requirements might make things interesting",,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 3:21 PM,"So I've moved on trying to adjust .xml files only finding that bohemia messed up when defining their own config values and now find myself looking through .pbo files to see if I can firstly find dynamic toxic zones and then see if I can alter dynamic toxic zones & finally add new dynamic toxic zones with custom ranges given the range is the thing that does not work for them currently.

So, for this kind of modding, am I in the right channel and if so am I correct by looking & trying to adjust .pbo files where-after I plan to upload the modded versions to the workshop?

The only reference I could find is

```
    class ContaminatedArea_Static: EffectArea
    {
        scope = 2;
    };
    class ContaminatedArea_Dynamic: EffectArea
    {
        scope = 2;

in config.cpp so I have no clue how to proceed from here",,
213272428154060800,muer,04/16/2022 3:42 PM,@TheAdmiral mind if I dm you a few questions about the battery thing? (and sorry for the ping if you don't appreciate that),,
144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,04/16/2022 3:47 PM,sure shoot me a question,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/16/2022 3:58 PM,Guess that makes 3 now üòõ I look forward to seeing you answer questions about it in the future üòõ,,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 4:16 PM,"So I did a search all for contaminatedArea_Dynamic and managed to stumble upon this and see it's worth for what I am trying to do:
( Original post by TheAdmiral on how to add toxic grenades)
```
class M18SmokeGrenade_Red_Contaminated extends M18SmokeGrenade_Red
{
    override void OnWorkStop()
    {
        super.OnWorkStop();
        
        if ( GetGame().IsServer() )
            GetGame().GetCEApi().SpawnGroup( ""ContaminatedArea_Dynamic"", GetPosition() );
    }
}
```

But then instead of a grenade I would make a new class ContaminatedArea_Radius100 extends ContaminatedArea_Dynamic All I need is to alter the radius of the area from 75 to 100. (I plan on making several different sized area's too)

So yeah I'm basically just using discord search to get to this point given I couldnt find even a bit of documentation on scripting (Including the channel's pinned items, or I must've looked over it)",,
231458456379326484,nlblackeagle,04/16/2022 4:18 PM,The only place next I could think of is arma2 scripting tutorials but then again contaminated gas zones are dayz exclusive so I doubt I would find any radius definitions there,,
397607224744083457,cygnusaurus,04/16/2022 4:41 PM,What is the difference between OnStartServer and OnExecuteServer?,,

OnStartServer is when the server is starting (But don't quote me on this lol, I've been only diving into DayZ scripting since about 2 hours ago)",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,04/18/2022 9:14 PM,You‚Äôd have to update on an interval just incase the object moves when outside network range,,

239723354657914880,maroonchy,04/18/2022 9:16 PM,if that target entity is replaced by a vector than the marker will have to be updated by the entity it' tracking instead,,

Try doing like action_data.m_Player.SetHealth(0); or some shit so you know the modified code is working. I know fucked method but its normally works
Once you know it works it should be as simple as in the final or maybe even ActionConditionContinue call the function to remove the fuel (Function created in Land_fuel thinggy) to remove the fuel for the last ""pump""

Afterwords just a check in here ActionCondition and here ActionConditionContinue for if the pump has fuel to kill the action mid thinggy if it runs out
