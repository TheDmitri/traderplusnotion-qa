208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:46 AM,so module 3 can check 4,,
208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:46 AM,but 4 cant check 3?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:46 AM,No,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,Correct,,
208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,interesting,,
208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,I wonder why they did it like that,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,That’s how the modules are loaded,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,you get used to it,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:47 AM,"1 is compiled first, then 2, then 3, then 4, then finally mission",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:48 AM,It’s JIT,,
208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:48 AM,ohh so 1 has to function on its own but 2 may need something from 1 to function?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:48 AM,Correct,,
208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:49 AM,okay now im confused why a class in mission cant get a class in game though?,,
214175043846930432,broman.dev,09/30/2020 3:50 AM,mission is module 5 and game is module 3,,

208117681516183552,swagodactyl,09/30/2020 3:50 AM,but when I try to override a class it says type not found or something like that,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,09/30/2020 3:53 AM,I’d be careful modding that boolean method though,,

To test your prints you can add one above the ‘true’ in your condition. And above tour false. However it will repeat as long as you are looking at your action target. You can also add them in the OnFinish. Make them stand out.,,

188628645928108033,rauuuuul,09/30/2020 7:56 AM,I think omega manager uses the rcon shutdown for restart,,
