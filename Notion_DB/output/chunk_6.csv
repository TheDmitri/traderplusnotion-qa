103599795305725952,lasyen,11/05/2018 6:15 AM,remove the ; on 129?,,
103599795305725952,lasyen,11/05/2018 6:16 AM,youre opening the class so its not starting a new line,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:17 AM,No it's fine,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:17 AM,that doesn't make sense because that puts me back to where I was originally but it didn't give an error this time,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:18 AM,Actually yeah,,
103599795305725952,lasyen,11/05/2018 6:18 AM,but its to do with the line before that,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:18 AM,Why did you add the ; at the end of 129,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:18 AM,Take it away,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:18 AM,Its not needed,,
103599795305725952,lasyen,11/05/2018 6:19 AM,i guess its expecting the class to be defined in {} after Rifle_Base,,
103599795305725952,lasyen,11/05/2018 6:19 AM,is line 128 required? I've not done any of this before so just poking in the dark,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:19 AM,"Do this
```
class Rifle_Base;
class USSR_cheytacM200: Rifle_Base

393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:19 AM,probably just me being tired anyways it worked thanks guys means a lot,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:19 AM,Np,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:21 AM,"Sorry @Lasyen I didn't mean to doubt you, I never realise he added it.",,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:21 AM,"Wait, who is porting arma 2?",,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:21 AM,It's completely different code.,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:21 AM,it's actually very similar,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:21 AM,üò¨,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:22 AM,"I mean, both are scripting languages.   They both have variables...",,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:22 AM,I'll stop there.,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:23 AM,"But I should also ask, the work someone wanted to port, was it their own?",,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:23 AM,You'll have to ask @RedTyler,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:23 AM,"Oh, he's talking about configs.",,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 6:24 AM,I saw this in scripting and thought he was talking about scripting.,,
331467213108281345,clarky03,11/05/2018 6:24 AM,Yeah weapon configs.,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:24 AM,Yeah realized was the wrong place afterwards,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:29 AM,"well, the gun isn't spawnable no idea why it was actually working better with the config from A2 and the mag doesn't have a model and when placed in hands crashes the game..",,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 6:29 AM,guess it's time to just delete as it's a waste of time anyways,,
159466008174657536,canadian420,11/05/2018 2:55 PM,Is it possible to do this to turn on all the street lamps at night?,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/509002928183443456/image0.png,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:02 PM,yes but the energy component would be a bit more complicated,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:03 PM,as well as getting the right values and params for the lighting configuration. 0 documentation so itll be trial and error :ResidentSleeper:,,
159466008174657536,canadian420,11/05/2018 3:05 PM,haha Ok thanks @Danny üå≠   üòÅ,,
159466008174657536,canadian420,11/05/2018 3:05 PM,This would be game changing imo,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:07 PM,i dont see why the devs wouldnt implement this feature themselves,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:07 PM,it can happen,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:07 PM,post 1.0 most likely,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,11/05/2018 3:10 PM,Haven't they always talked about getting power stations up and running someday?,,
483945142424698881,nines9805,11/05/2018 3:10 PM,"@Danny üå≠  they had it in back in .45 i think only for a short while then removed it , coz it made more issues then being helpful",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,it was just static part of the model,,
483945142424698881,nines9805,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,yeah,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,and it made no sense for lights to be on,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,all the time at night,,
159466008174657536,canadian420,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,"I think they are planning to do it, but who knows when..  lol",,
483945142424698881,nines9805,11/05/2018 3:11 PM,yeah but could only see the change at night anyway,,
483945142424698881,nines9805,11/05/2018 3:12 PM,"i dont think they will tbh , i think they'll leave the modders to do it",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:12 PM,itll be a similar process with implementing the PA system,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:12 PM,except itll have to be more complex,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:12 PM,but defs dooable,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:12 PM,grab 1 designer and assign him to do it over the course of a few months,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/05/2018 3:13 PM,ez,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,11/05/2018 3:13 PM,"I am not looking forward to someone enabling all the lights without any in game mechanic to power them, reee muh immersion",,
159466008174657536,canadian420,11/05/2018 3:13 PM,lol,,

268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 7:32 PM,"I'm looking through some userscripts right now. Is this really C? I see constructors, destructors, objects. No pointers of any sort. Can DayZ even understand things like pointers or structures?",,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 7:33 PM,This looks rather like C++,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/05/2018 7:36 PM,No its not C,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/05/2018 7:36 PM,Its a bit retarded child from c++ and java,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/05/2018 7:37 PM,You dont see every language feature work as you would expect - so the script lang still need some love but its allright to use,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 7:37 PM,"Alright. So I think I'll probably look in learning a bit c++. I think until they are releasing a documentation that's the best thing to do, right?",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/05/2018 7:38 PM,"Yes, but it should be a matter of a few weeks until you see it all",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,11/05/2018 7:38 PM,Get an understanding for OOP,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 7:39 PM,"I'm intermediate at java. I think I can handle OOP. I just need to learn the syntax of c++. But it's nice that I don't have to wait that long.

Thank you",,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,11/05/2018 8:45 PM,theres not much c++ going on,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,11/05/2018 8:49 PM,enforce is closer to java then to c++,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,11/05/2018 9:01 PM,its a mix of c# java php,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 9:40 PM,For example I don't understand the : operator in the classname. is it like extends or implements? Isn't that a c++ thing?,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 9:41 PM,or the ref Datatype,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,11/05/2018 9:49 PM,: to inherit from the class,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,11/05/2018 9:49 PM,same as extend,,

268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 9:53 PM,Thank you,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 9:57 PM,so the ref operator is kinda like static in java?,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 10:00 PM,or like if you would pass a pointer to a function and change the value it holds in that function. the variable oustide the function would get changed as well,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 10:01 PM,so ref is like *ptr,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,11/05/2018 10:07 PM,"Are you looking at configs, or scripts?",,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 10:08 PM,just looking through scripts right now,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 10:10 PM,e.g.,,
268085282220408834,vogtivogel,11/05/2018 10:10 PM,ref TStringArray Bags = {};,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,11/05/2018 10:29 PM,ref is a pointer yeah,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 11:56 PM,"Okay got something for everyone this one is a script for server, I'm trying to run a switch command then loop the switch every 15 minutes until it gets case 5 once case 5 is true I want it to sleep 30 minutes then run more different code and then reset the entire thing",,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 11:56 PM,help plz?,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/05/2018 11:57 PM,by reset I mean start over so it'd start running the switch statement again,,

392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,11/06/2018 12:27 AM,"yes, could be done with `ScriptCallQueue.CallLater(..)` in  tools.c",,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/06/2018 12:29 AM,Any answer to my question got my stumped üò¶,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,11/06/2018 12:30 AM,maybe if you write it down properly its easier to help,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/06/2018 12:30 AM,I‚Äôll do my best,,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/06/2018 12:32 AM,Basically I need it to run the switch statement then if case5 was chose then it needs to run a different block of code,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,11/06/2018 12:32 AM,"but in case you are looking for switch case it would be
```java
switch(VAR) {
    case COND:

}
```",,
393880982182428673,.redtyler,11/06/2018 1:05 AM,Thanks for that Zed but not what I quite needed. Anyone else have any advice?,,
295660175237447691,sentepu,11/06/2018 1:20 AM,it is. switch + CallLater() is all you need.,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:03 AM,"yeet, so i make that hoe on the clients missionGameplay",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:04 AM,so its a client side player?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:04 AM,yup,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:04 AM,i tried to replicate the main menu script,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:05 AM,"DayZIntroScene, everything works 100% because the code is just pasta from the devs one. BUT these players spawn in T Pose",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:11 AM,so i can go look at dayzintroscene yea?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:11 AM,ya,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,perhaps the player being spawned isnt being ticked,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,since you're in a server environment,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,its routing to a different function,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,"yea, thats what i was thinking",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,in missionServer theres an array that holds dummy players,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:14 AM,that the server then ticks if you add it to the scheduler,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,maybe u'd be better,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,hm no this is interesting,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,"i asked how Zap did it, have not got a reply yet",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,spawning playerbase on client side causes them not to init animations and stuff yea?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,his lobby for PVP engine,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,server side players,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:15 AM,createobject called on server most likely,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:16 AM,or perhaps they are actually real players,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:16 AM,yea but...that would tsack the players in the scene ?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:16 AM,not client side ones,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:16 AM,no u dont need to spawn players for each client,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:16 AM,its multiplayer,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,u just move them all to one location. client side the camera to that position then interact with menus. that way anything each player does is synced naturally,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,such as setting loadout,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,having client side players would require you to manually sync it,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,which is not what u want,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,true,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:17 AM,thanks,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:18 AM,i'd definitely like it if,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/06/2018 4:18 AM,someone made a lobby framework,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:18 AM,where you could select starterup gear and location based on in game GUI map,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:19 AM,"ok well if i use an MP player, wouldn't other players see that same player on their screen?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/06/2018 4:19 AM,if that  makes any sense,,

That I am afraid will require repack of the map (which you cant really do with Chernarus). The way the connection between map object and config is (in most cases) done using named property class=house (or other special house property) and Land_ prefix on the config side. You can definitely override existing Land_ class by config (loading it after the original one), but as for adding a new class, dont think its possible without repacking the whole map, but you can try to add Land_selectedmodelname into your mod config to see if anything changes in the game.",,

What interests me however is how Trees and Bushes are populated by these Tree hard and BushHard config types without actually being defined in config for each model? And it seems like their naming is specifically required to have such prefix in order for the engine to assign the objects to that type? Just wondering how that works. Example i tried looking for any sort of defines for pine trees since their object type is TreeHard but i couldnt find any sort of class in plants pbo. Just a thought.,,
