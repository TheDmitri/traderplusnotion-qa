218413499947155456,steve_aka_salutesh,02/18/2023 10:40 PM,I would probably go for catching in ItemBase OnInventoryEnter and OnInventoryExit when the event is ending and when its your item delete it.,,

    return new NutritionalProfile( GetFoodEnergy(item, classname, food_stage),

  }

  static float GetFat(ItemBase item, string classname = """", int food_stage = 0)
  {

They are a door kit and window kit for fortification. I have removed the types from the types.xml but players seem able to still craft them using the two sticks and rope. I have also tried to unpack the PBO but it keeps saying error on attempting to unpack them... Any idea?,,

If you got errors when trying to unpack it most likely it is obfuscated, you should contact the person that made it. Also one of the ways to do it is to write small patch for that pbo that will disable the crafting recipe if there is no way to get in contact with the creator",,
