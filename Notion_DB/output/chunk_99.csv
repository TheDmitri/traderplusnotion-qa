614589291393187966,joseph40104,08/31/2021 9:01 PM,"hey Helkhiana, thanks for posting this, I found it while searching for how to offset a holo. I made a container item out of a vanilla box, and it is working as I want except when placing it is halfway through the ground, so I am trying to apply a Z offset to the placement holo

here is the item code:
```    class BigBox: Container_Base
    {
        scope=2;
        displayName=""Big Box"";
        descriptionShort=""There are many boxes like this box, but this box is yours."";
        model=""\DZ\structures\industrial\cementworks\proxy\misc_boxwooden.p3d"";
        hologramMaterial=""power_generator"";
        hologramMaterialPath=""dz\gear\camping\data"";
        slopeTolerance=0.40000001;
        yawPitchRollLimit[]={45,45,45};
        weight=10000;
        itemBehaviour=0;
        itemSize[]={10,10};
        carveNavmesh=1;
        canBeDigged=0;
        rotationFlags=2;
        heavyItem=1;
        physLayer=""item_small"";
        class Cargo
        {
            itemsCargoSize[]={10,25};
            openable=0;
            allowOwnedCargoManipulation=1;
        };
        hiddenSelections[]=
        {
            ""camoGround""
        };
        hiddenSelectionsTextures[]=
        {
            ""dz\gear\camping\data\power_generator_CO.paa""
        };```

and then here is the modded hologram.c using your snippet

```modded class Hologram
{
    override void UpdateHologram( float timeslice )
    {
        super.UpdateHologram(timeslice);

        BigBox plot = BigBox.Cast(m_Parent);
        if(plot){
            vector plotPos = GetProjectionEntityPosition( m_Player ) + ""0 0.5 0"";
            vector plotOrientation = AlignProjectionOnTerrain( timeslice );
            SetProjectionPosition( plotPos );
            SetProjectionOrientation( plotOrientation );        
            m_Projection.OnHologramBeingPlaced( m_Player );
            return;
        }
    }

456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/03/2021 10:34 PM,Some modded items have this Problem. It occurs when the damage states in the config.cpp have malicious numbers. (1 instead of 1.0 and 0 instead of 0.0) it will show the wrong health state in this case. You can test this by taking it into your hands and punching a wall. If the item drops out of your hands it's mostly what I said,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/03/2021 10:35 PM,The item needs to be ruined. If it's not actually ruined this will not happen. We had this with a lot of items from fidov on our server. I know fidov :overit:,,
