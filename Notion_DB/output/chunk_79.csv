320057281335001089,thestr4ng3r,02/28/2021 7:45 PM,"Hello everyone (@BRITTO?) . Question regarding the use of cfgCharacterScenes. I've been working on it myself and its working perfectly, aside from one problem. When I try to place the character in an elevated position (In test cases, on top of an apartment building in Elektro), it puts the player ""target"" at ground level, as if the apartment building isn't even there, forcing the camera to just stare at the the ground level of the apartment building. The odd part is that the camera elevation value is working just fine, so I'm left with the camera staring straight down at the apartment building. Does anyone know how to force the elevation of the target to actually work? Here's my class, it SHOULD be putting the character on the corner of the roof of the northernmost apartment building in Elektro:
```
class cfgCharacterScenes
{
    class ChernarusPlus
    {
        class loc1
        {
            target[]={10264.299805,2520.929932,43}; // Actual roof level is about 41.5, set to 43 as a safety
            position[]={10265.803711,2522.007324,23}; // From what I've seen, camera elevation is ground elevation (Roughly 20 at these coords) + VAR, equaling roughly the same elevation as target elevation. This actually works fine so far.

135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/03/2021 8:37 AM,this would keep network traffic to a minimum,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/03/2021 8:37 AM,you could also store a before and after to see if it changes. but that increases server overhead,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/06/2021 12:45 PM,its bit masking,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,03/06/2021 12:46 PM,also im going to remove that since its a but unnecessary,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,03/06/2021 1:30 PM,"well, it's good for clarity",,
