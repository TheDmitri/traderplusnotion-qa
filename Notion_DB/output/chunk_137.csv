this enforce/c language is comlex af for me. 😄

ive managed to create two objects. one is a door and another is a building based on free sample that bi provides. managed to animate them and make them work in game.

i want to make them the door and the doors of the building only interactable for one steam id. i also have scripts to open close doors. i believe i need an if statement.

        matchType.ToLower();

        array<EntityAI> entities = GetNearbyEntities(RB_GetKonfig().search_radius);
        int containerCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < entities.Count(); i++)

            EntityAI envEntity = entities.Get(i);

Then you can just cast your item onto `target_object`. But in OnStartServer, you only have `ActionData action_data`, so you cant use cast. How can i run a function of the item on the item, on server start?",,

I managed to start the timer when not next to the laptop, works perfect and the timer finishes and works like normal. I have it so when youre looking at the laptop, you can see the remaining time on the timer while youre looking at it, however when i started my test server, and joined 15 seconds later, the timers were out of sync, the servers timer finished before the clients (i could tell because i had the server make a notification when the timer finished.

    {

        if (enitityInHands && enitityInHands == this)

When specifying other static objects, everything works.

I have an opinion that the reason for everything is the fact that Static_tent_gunrack is not located separately on the map, but in a building, for example, in Land_Mil_Tent_Big1_1 and is located inside the object according to the offset data in Land_Mil_Tent_Big1_1 OFFSET is <<0,127384, 0,405375, 1,277192>>. With manual calculations , taking away data on the offset from the coordinates of the head object , all one coordinates are broken .
