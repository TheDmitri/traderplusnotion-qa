228312873619816448,britto,07/06/2022 8:21 AM,It is not creating any Null pointers. I will check your mod.,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,07/06/2022 8:21 AM,I think the total weight on players is only set and updated on the server,,
228312873619816448,britto,07/06/2022 8:21 AM,The function is in PlayerBase (which is not a client?),,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,07/06/2022 8:23 AM,GetHealth01 for example can only be used on server. While playing sounds can only be done on client,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,07/06/2022 8:24 AM,What I want so say is that only the server updates the weight of the player when items are added etc. The code is not run on the client. Therefore it simply remains 0 all the time,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,07/06/2022 8:24 AM,Since it's not synced to the client,,

Well, i kinda need help with debugging. I want to modify a mod, i did it, after few server starts i managed to get rid of all errors that showed up on server startup, after that i took client-side logs and also fixed all errors. 

rn my mod runs like:
Server-side: runs perfectly, mission loads, server successfully starts
Client-side: run up to timer point (15 second before join), after that it just stucks up on loading.

And i dont understand, how can i get error message in that case.

How do i debug? 
I start DayzDiag in server and client modes, start Script editor and connect it to client.
There is not valuable messages in ""Output"" section. And my code compiles correct. 

Error looks like an infinite loop error, but i have already checked code and dont see any big troubles.",,

Any idea on how to spawn **correctly** a mag as attachment for a weapon ?

If I wanted to set a M4, let's call it gun : `EntityAI gun = player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInHands(""M4A1"");`
Then add to it a ready-to-use mag of 30 : `gun.GetInventory().CreateAttachment(""Mag_CMAG_30Rnd"")`.

This would work, but my players won't be able to reload using the key (R), only by removing the mag by hand and draging another one.
The only way to reload ""normaly"" using a keyboard is to spray the exact 30 bullets before and make sure the mag is empty.

Or at least if there is no ""fix"" to this bug, is there a way to force the reload action for the player when he spawn ?",,

@Wardog my goal is to have a certain number of Zone choose by the user from a JSON [ XCenter with Radius ]  in which happen things ( get damage / Efx ecc ]

for example:

3 zones at some coords

1 start at the start of the server, last 30 minutes then disappear for X minutes and then appers ecc

2 start after 10 minutes ecc

3...

all these are managed by some timers the set the disappearing/appearing stuff",,

I always thought EEItemAttached triggers when i add an item in a slot. Am i wrong?

I'm also wondering if I don't have a logic error. I check if the item put in the slot is ""Fabric"". And I check if the number in the slot is ""4"". I don't check the quantity of the item, but of the slot, since it's quite possible that you put in 2 times 2 or one after the other.

But now if I want to put 4 Fabric in it, EEItemAttached will (or should) fire as soon as I drag the stack onto the slot. The slot is then checked, but still has 0 items because the fabric stack is now being placed but has not yet been placed.
