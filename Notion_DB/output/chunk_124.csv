266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 3:17 PM,"but i also like how you say the stuff is easy shit to fix, if that was the case then why cant the developers do it? If its that easy surely it wouldnt take up too much of their time. Sure they have a lot of shit to get through, a lot of things to do. But if its that easy then it should be fixed already, so your argument is very counter productive. Complaining is annoying to hear i get it, but thats what happens when you create a product. nobody is ever satisfied, its impossible to satisfy everyone.",,

Bugs are an unfortunate thing that every game of this stature will have. But to say let me know how you would do with a game of this size isnt really the argument.

266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:14 PM,gonna try many other containers,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:15 PM,its weird i dont think it works since this one container isnt always showing i have to open another to get it to show,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:16 PM,if i open when im too close to it i cant see inside,,

266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:20 PM,Ah so i think it may actually fix the barrel issue but the much stuff is because its a container with attachments and it uses a different script i think,,
180742443681972224,107er,06/15/2022 6:23 PM,You have put it into 5_mission?,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:25 PM,Yeah i did,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:25 PM,i think it fixes the barrels i cant get the barrels to not show the cargo anymore,,
180742443681972224,107er,06/15/2022 6:25 PM,That‚Äôs weird,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:25 PM,but much stuff still does.,,

266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:27 PM,if i wait 1-2 seconds before pressing tab the stuff will show flawlessly,,

266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:27 PM,aight ill try it,,
180742443681972224,107er,06/15/2022 6:29 PM,But I don‚Äôt think it will help tbh,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:29 PM,yeah i think its to do with this though,,

266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:29 PM,i assume its handled different when its a container that has attachment slots,,
266950437805096970,zookemike,06/15/2022 6:30 PM,so thats why maybe it fixes the barrels since theres no attachments such as backpacks or guns or whatever u can put in it.,,
180742443681972224,107er,06/15/2022 6:30 PM,Maybe yea,,

I have an animation, that always worked but now I reworked my base class for furniture and it doesn't work anymore.
Other rotation animations work just fine.

The animation works correct in BD, so i assume, that my LODs and model.cfg are fine.

This is the animation class in the config:
```class AnimationSources
        {
            class cover
            {
                source=""user"";
                initPhase=0;
                animPeriod=0.5;
            };
        };```


This the function to set the animation phase in the script:
```
override void UpdateVisualState()
    {
        if ( IsOpen() )
        {
            SetAnimationPhase(""cover"",1);
        }
        else
        {
            SetAnimationPhase(""cover"",0);
        }
    }
```
