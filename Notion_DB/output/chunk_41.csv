@Happy 

> Why making it a managed object

To be freed automatically when last ref is removed (meaning the private static ref HTSettings m_Globals)

> But in this case its not even needed as its all static data

It's not all static data, all HTSettings data is allocated dynamically, not static. The only static var is the ref to it m_Globals",,
575954046054301696,lucianpin,10/09/2019 10:18 AM,"If doing it like this, then all are static, you just have them grouped:
```
class HTSettings
{
    //default values
    static int g_WoodenPlank_From_Log_Quantity = 3;
    static int g_WoodenPlank_From_LumberPile_Quantity = 9;
    static int g_LumberPile_RemovedPlanks = 3; //how many to reduce from lumber pile    
    static int g_WoodenLog_From_Tree_Quantity = 1;
    static float g_Firewood_From_Tree_Multiplier = 1;//unkown if possible to increase: trying to use multiplier
    static int g_Firewood_From_Log_Quantity = 3;
    static float g_LargeStone_From_Rock_Multiplier = 1; //unkown if possible to increase
    static int g_SmallStone_From_LargeStone_Quantity = 2;    
};
```

But from allocation perspective it is the same as just droping these lines into some file like global vars:
int g_WoodenPlank_From_Log_Quantity = 3;
....

I just mean do as you like, but there are differences...",,

<https://feedback.bistudio.com/T145543>

here's the workaround i came up with for the meantime
```csharp
bool MakeDirectoryTree(string path)
{
    auto str = new array<string>();
    bool success = true;

    path.Replace(""\\"", ""/"");
    path.Split(""/"", str);

    string dir = str[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < str.Count(); i++)
    {
        if (!success) break;
        string s = str.Get(i);

        dir += ""/"" + s;
        if (!s.Contains("".""))
            success = MakeDirectory(dir);
    }

    delete str;
    return success;
}
```
Usage:
```csharp
bool success = MakeDirectoryTree(""$profile:/Parent/Child/Grandchild/somefile.json"");
Print(""MakeDirectoryTree::"" + success);

You can also remove the check for lethal damage, and just have it apply shock instead of instantly killing all the passengers if something goes wrong. You can also remove the process of light damage, it's just adding negative health.",,👍 (1)

Before I start, I apologize if this has already been asked and I just haven't found it when looking through the search results, but can anyone help me with a bit of code that I can put into my `init.c` file to tell people ingame 15, 10, 5 and 1 minutes before restart.

I do already have this setup in the BEC scheduler, but I want to move it to the init.c so I can use the VPPNotifications instead, as people seem to overlook the warnings in just chat.

I know how to do the notification itself, I just want to know the best way (as I don't know C) as I know timers can smash cpu usage if not used correctly.
