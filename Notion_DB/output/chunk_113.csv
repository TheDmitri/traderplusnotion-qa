164872154154795008,zelik,02/10/2022 4:02 PM,The condition works correctly.,,
164872154154795008,zelik,02/10/2022 4:02 PM,The progress will not end.  The circle just spins,,
245298483056214026,yama2k2,02/10/2022 4:40 PM,emat is used on objects,,

272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:07 PM,"saying that, @spectramodz if you want it to spawn the effect on player then you need to create a water surface that will be attached to the player on top of him/her, then create a water emat to go with that specific object and make all the normal water effects be gone except for the one you want",,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:07 PM,Bit hacky but the only way to achieve it,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:08 PM,Spawn it locally on client,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/10/2022 5:08 PM,What do you mean? Is it a file?,,
220980493276020736,.gramps.,02/10/2022 5:08 PM,yes a .c file,,

272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:11 PM,As this one is only triggered underwater,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:11 PM,Just trigger it out of water,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:11 PM,What you will do is change the default setting for that specific emat only when you are underwater,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:11 PM,You can't,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:12 PM,Why? Is there something I am fundamentally missing with ppeffects?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:13 PM,What PPEffects does is that it allows you to load the enfusion material,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:13 PM,and change global settings for them,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:13 PM,When they get triggered is out of the point of that manager,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:13 PM,"Some PP effects are always running and thus you can ""enable"" them by changing the settings to a point where they ""start to take effect""",,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:14 PM,Whenever they actually get processed is up to the engine logic,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:14 PM,All of them are processed always except for WetDistort and UnderWaterEffects,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,You can even register there an emat for a particle,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,And animate it there,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,I assume this isn't documented and more tribal knowledge?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,"But ""enabling"" it there won't make it show as an effect",,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,I hope you see where this is going,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,Not documented at all as always,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:15 PM,"Yeah, if the engine ignores it then there is nothing I can do",,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:16 PM,So it is the `Graphics/Materials/postprocess/uw` material that is ignored completely?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:16 PM,"Like, if I made my own using that, it would still be ignored?",,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:16 PM,"Yes, until you get below a water surface",,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:16 PM,and then,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,Love non documented things,,🤣 (1)
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,It could also be ignored if the water surface has a different one defined for it,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,How tf does it know lol,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,(Custom UnderWater emat),,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,There is a setting for the water materials that allows you to set a custom under water effects emat,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:17 PM,Underwater Effects are different than the Water effects,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/10/2022 5:18 PM,It's a mix of the two so you have to check which one has the stuff you would want  to see,,

456226577798135808,Deleted User,02/13/2022 7:57 AM,Coming to what @MisterJ said @CashewSan. What your issue could be is this and I have the same bug still in my medic mod. When adding shock periodically over time you are fighting against the shock refill Playermodifier. So depending on that you have to add more shock than the modifier refills. Adding a fixed number does not really work in all cases. You have to account for the deltaT as you don't know how often the ticks are being called,,👍 (1)
456226577798135808,Deleted User,02/13/2022 7:57 AM,It does work. I used it multiple times successful already,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,02/13/2022 7:59 AM,What is missing in the example from my mod is multiplying the number that gets added with deltaT,,
99298225999056896,cashewsan,02/13/2022 8:02 AM,So how do I fight against the shock refill playermodifier? Just have a higher number than it per tick?,,

272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:26 AM,and thus your endpos also will,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:26 AM,You need yo shoot a ray from something that is not ground level,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:26 AM,For example 1 meter up,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:26 AM,or the player head pos in world space,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,02/15/2022 3:27 AM,so if I raise it up 0.25m it would then give actual direction?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:27 AM,The direction is always correct,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:27 AM,The issue here is how you are thinking about it,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:27 AM,Think of it like a gun for example,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:27 AM,begPos is where the muzzle is at,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,02/15/2022 3:28 AM,gotcha. That gives me something to work with.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:28 AM,And endPos is where you would want to cap for example the trajectory of the bulltet,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:28 AM,Let's say that the bullet will always travel in a straight line,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:29 AM,Then endPos will tell you the trajectory it could take,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:29 AM,So if you want it to be directly infront of startPos then just use your formula,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:29 AM,But if in that case startPos was at ground level,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:30 AM,Then because that formula only translates the startPos vector forward 2 meters then it would be 2 meters forward and still ground level,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:30 AM,This is why you need to lift up startPos in the begginning if you are getting it from` GetPosition()`,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,02/15/2022 3:31 AM,Basically yes. Ok so I’ll set begPos at head lvl. And it will follow cursor to end pos?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:32 AM,If you use this formula here then yes https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/492295576470290433/942969269656895499,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,02/15/2022 3:33 AM,Ok so then my mistake was starting at ground lvl.,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/15/2022 3:33 AM,yes,,
