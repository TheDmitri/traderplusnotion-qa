    AddAction(ActionTurnOnPowerGenerator);
    AddAction(ActionTurnOffPowerGenerator);
    AddAction(ActionPlaceObject);
}
```
These action assume different possibilities, since your using action like ""ActionPlaceObject"", you can pretend the action of placement on server side is made there, so that why your actual code was double spawning your object; making your custom action would be more useful in some case, but if you only want to deploy exactly what hologram show, I suggest to use the `ActionPlaceObject` (Similar method can be found in Tentbase)",,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:26 PM,yeah also noticed the blanking problem :/,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:26 PM,Then I think I will write my own class for translations,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:27 PM,But I dont get how the used language can be found out ^^ maybe some intern stuff we will never have access to?,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:27 PM,"The only problem I had with stringtable, is blanck text when you change language",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:27 PM,And this will be fixed in the future,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:28 PM,yeah but when using .Length of a string it will gives you the length of the placeholder and not of the translated string :/,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/11/2019 6:28 PM,Might be able to pull something from the bios classes to get the active language. Not sure. I'm in the process of moving,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:28 PM,Alright thanks Wardog,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:29 PM,WIll give this a go,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,09/11/2019 6:29 PM,Why would you want to get the length of the message? 🤔,,
327640512570064898,digiacomtech,09/11/2019 6:30 PM,@Dr_J0nes ... Sorry to but in and change the subject but any chance you can look at that Trader update I sent you?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/11/2019 6:32 PM,I think he's wanting to set a buffer size for the widget with the length of the translation,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:32 PM,"Yeah, why you would need a length of the message ?",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:33 PM,You could with UI sync the height of your widget with the height of your text,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:38 PM,@NiiRoZz I tried that the whole day ^^ Problem is that the root widget doenst updates its size accordingly to the size of the multilinetextbox,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,It's should be possible to make this,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,Have you ever worked with height sync of widgets?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,yeah I thinked so too. Spend the last 6 hours on that..,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,"if you get the height size of your text widget, and apply it to the root one",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,it should fix the issue no ?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,thats exactly what I tried,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:40 PM,but nope,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:41 PM,in workbench I can clearly see that the size of the textbox is syncing with the text but ingame the root widgets size is still 0 when I set it to the textbox size,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:42 PM,Did you tried to call update to the root ?,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:42 PM,update function to text and parent ?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:42 PM,widget.Update()?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:43 PM,nope didnt tried that ^^,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:46 PM,thanks will give it a go,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 6:46 PM,"I don't know if it's will fix it, but don't know why in workbench, it's working and not in game",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:51 PM,nope 😦,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:52 PM,updated the textwidget before I get the size and updated the root widget after setting the size,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:53 PM,Workbenc is just strange with layouts.. In workbench you can give the root an color and it shows up colored in workbench but ingame its not ^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 6:56 PM,hm ok maybe I am just stupid ^^ I have messed up something else. Will fix that and try again,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:12 PM,okay still the same mess,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:13 PM,had to give the textbox a bigger start size? altho it should update its size accordingly to the text content..,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:13 PM,when getting the size of the textbox it gives back the start size and not the synced one,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:18 PM,here I can clearly see that the size fits the text in workbench..,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/621394179376807948/Unbenannt.PNG,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:26 PM,"how do you get widget size, when setting to root",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:26 PM,using getsize ?,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:26 PM,you should use GetTextSize,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:26 PM,instead,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:27 PM,GetTextSize?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:28 PM,"I use `""exact text"" 1` and `""exact text size"" 15` does that matter?",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:30 PM,will give it a try,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:35 PM,"yes, because you want the text size, not the size of the widget",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:35 PM,But don't know if GetTextSize is about font or text size,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 7:35 PM,should be text size,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:46 PM,lol that gives me back 0 for y axis^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 7:48 PM,RichTextWidget has afunction of get COntent Height maybe I try out that one,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:05 PM,Okay RichTextWidget saved my life,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:05 PM,GetContentHeight() and GetNumLines() were the key,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 8:05 PM,can you share how you done it ?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:05 PM,Thanks again for your time @NiiRoZz,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 8:06 PM,"Maybe this will be helpful in the future, that's why asking you",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:08 PM,"I had already an notioication system running that measured how many lines of text the message is and then sets the size of the root widget by that line amount (multiplied with the textsize of course). Because of stringtables getting translated when the string gets displkayed I wasnt able to do string manipulation and stuff to measure how many lines of text the translated message has. When you use RichTextWidget you set the Text, after that I used GetNumLines() and set the root widget size by that. So my old notification system worked again.",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 8:10 PM,How do you get the textsize ?,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/11/2019 8:11 PM,GetContentHeight just not doing automatically this line amount * text size ?,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:11 PM,Yeah you are right instead of multiplying the line amount with an constant value I could use the COntent height instead.,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:12 PM,But for now it works fine,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/11/2019 8:12 PM,"I got the Text Size by guessing. I knew the plain text size was 15 so I played around and 20 gave the best results because of line spacing and stuff.
