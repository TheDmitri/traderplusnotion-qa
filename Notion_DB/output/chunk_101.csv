173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:53 PM,items that really shouldn't have `m_isBoughtFromPvPTrader = true` actually seem to have it,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:54 PM,if you add anything to the persistence when a file is saved (OnStoreSave / OnStoreLoad) it potentially fucks up every item already on the server due to the load order getting kinda fucked,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:55 PM,yeah that's what I think too,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:55 PM,the stuff is written and read back in the order the mods are loaded,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,ok maybe the mod has to have more DZ_ in requiredAddons?,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,"like, all the item stuff?",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,and if you insert something in the chain of that store/load it can happen that a mod that reads value x actually reads your your added value and not the one it expects,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,no not really,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,once added it is fucked,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:56 PM,a wipe will fix it,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:57 PM,I see,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:57 PM,as every item created now is created with the complete set of values saved and loaded,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:58 PM,that's pretty fucked up,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:58 PM,think of it like this: item a is created before you added your mod and it saves lets say 5 values. now you add your mod adding another value so it is 6 values total. the server starts and the item wants to load 6 values but there are only 5 stored,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 1:58 PM,what happens?,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:59 PM,huh,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:59 PM,but why does the mod see the value as true then,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 1:59 PM,when it shouldn't even exist,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 2:00 PM,because your mod might be loaded as the 3rd mod and therefore it can load a value from the 5 prev saved. and the mod that is loaded last will fail as there is no value left to read,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:00 PM,my toenails curl up,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:01 PM,maybe the approach to create specific pvp items wasn't too bad after all,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:02 PM,"less nice, but more robust",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 2:03 PM,it is absolutely reasonable to add additional values to be saved with OnStoreSave and loaded later on. you just have to keep in mind what it means to do such thing,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:06 PM,"so after a wipe, everything will be fine? but the mod has to be active all the time, I guess",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:06 PM,"once it's inactive for only one restart, things will be fucked again",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 2:07 PM,exactly. if you remove a mod you end up with the same problem in reverse. like 6 values stored but only 5 read at first start and if your mod was not at the end some mod(s) will read wrong values,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:09 PM,"alright, thx a bunch man",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,09/26/2021 2:11 PM,"huh, but what if a new gear mod will be introduced later, can this cause any issues?",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 2:12 PM,everytime a mod is added using OnStoreLoad on a base class like ItemBase will result in the same fucked up behavior if not loaded as the very last mod so its not messing with said save/load order,,

456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/26/2021 8:47 PM,its not about introducing items its about mods that modify OnStoreLoad/Save of base classes like ItemBase,,
