Since 1.09 it has been done at the engine level, and I cannot for the life of me reconstruct the equation with the given coefficients in the configs.
On the suppressor itself you have `barrelArmor` with a value of something like 3000, and in `DamageSystem->GlobalHealth->Health->hitpoints` you have something like 2, the ammo has `damageBarrel` and `damageBarrelDestroyed` normally the same or similar at like 125.342, the weapon has `barrelArmor` as well set to something like 0.8.
If I raise the number of `DamageSystem->GlobalHealth->Health->hitpoints` there is an exponential impact to how many rounds from a weapon it takes to ruin a suppressor.. I just cannot find the math for this..",,

It is still not working well for some reason

First case:
`...output = prefix + name + "" item"" + postfix;...`
Display name is `"" item"" + postfix`
Both `prefix` and `name` are ignored

Second case:
`...output = prefix + name + postfix;...`

Just `prefix` is ignored

106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:38 PM,no errors now so looking good haha,,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:40 PM,i still get the option to pack it down with an attachment and and item in storage tho 😭,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/12/2022 9:43 PM,return false then,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/12/2022 9:43 PM,ActionCondition = true = do the action || ActionCondition = false dont do the action,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/12/2022 9:44 PM,You can technically do the same cargo check in the dismantle recipe `bool Can()` function,,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:47 PM,testing it as false now,,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:51 PM,it also gives the option when set to `false`,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,04/12/2022 9:52 PM,Then your condition of `if (targetEggRack && !player.IsPlacingLocal())` is evaluating to true,,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:53 PM,yes it is ill try that as false,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/12/2022 9:55 PM,Yea that was more of an or when you separate them like that… nest both your true state meets together.,,
106867714374569984,dave_p.,04/12/2022 9:57 PM,"setting this to false removes the option when it has an attachment and cargo. thanks for all of the help.

i will try and remember this for the future",,
