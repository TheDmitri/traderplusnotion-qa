105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,02/20/2019 2:51 PM,Currently there are :monkaOMEGA: bugs that are tilting me beyond sanity,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/20/2019 3:05 PM,@nofu pls we want MakeDirectory(); a thing again,,
522416513345650708,nofu4293,02/20/2019 3:11 PM,"@DaOne(Mark) With these things, security is always an aspect to consider.",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,02/20/2019 3:11 PM,Thanks Nofu,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,02/20/2019 3:14 PM,"@nofu Like said to Eugen, do like DeleteFile, make it works only on ""$profile:"" and ""$saves:"" locations. Don't know why you can delete/make file but not directory.",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,02/20/2019 3:14 PM,Because you can send it arbitrary byte [],,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,02/20/2019 3:15 PM,You can literally dump a executable on the disk,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,02/20/2019 3:15 PM,That is why WriteFile is always sketch,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,02/20/2019 3:15 PM,Combine that with making directory structures,,
522416513345650708,nofu4293,02/20/2019 3:20 PM,"Quite frankly, i'm not a programmer nor a security specialist, if it got disabled, it was for a reason and i suspect there must have been some merit to it, if it turns out it prevents modders from producing quality mods(or makes creating them unnecessarily difficult - which seems unlikely but i'm not ruling it out), it can always be re-considered with some additional security.",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,02/20/2019 3:22 PM,There is a limit to how many files can be created in the profiles or saves directory. Without a make directory function it means that either a) the folders have to be created before the server starts up or b) hope that there isn't 500 files are in that directory.,,
522416513345650708,nofu4293,02/20/2019 3:26 PM,"I understand, but at the same time, i fail to see the need for 500+ files produced by game mods.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/20/2019 3:27 PM,"ü§îhe‚Äôs got a point, 500 is not bad for a limit, the folders just made it more categorised. I guess we at least have the Json serializer :OmegaPog: üëç",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,02/20/2019 3:27 PM,"I can't confirm at the moment but I believe it includes the crash, script and rpt logs that are always created for each server startup",,
522416513345650708,nofu4293,02/20/2019 3:28 PM,That would be an issue then.,,

456226577798135808,Deleted User,03/03/2019 7:44 AM,if you wanted any differences between the fireplaces you were placing and the default vanilla ones (say you wanted to increase the lifetime of your custom placed fireplaces while leaving the standard vanilla despawn rate for normal fireplaces) then you could deifnitely make a custom class and edit it accordingly but from the sounds of it (unless im misunderstanding) for that bit you could just use init.c COM action to have those fireplaces spawn at the locations you want on every server start up. I havent studied the fireplace code hard yet but just from guessing the normal fireplace and the stones fireplace might be a hiddenselection kinda thing both handled from the same p3d so if you desired your custom fireplace to always be a stone fireplace you could probably set the model to that state OR a more complicated choice would be to go into the fireplace script where all that nonsense is handled and force the stone transistion,,

What method are you using to lock your rock to the ground? m_isTakeable and the other setTakeable thing (cant remember syntax right now) both remove mouse over interactions as far as I know so even if your recipe is set up properly it wouldn't work that way so you'd have to use a different method to lock it down like a barrel or somethin.",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,03/03/2019 8:47 AM,also was thinking it would be cooler to have the pickaxe swinging animation but that would probably require some fun scripting stuff like making a new action orr drawing off the existing pickaxe swing animation and adding some bit of code in about deleting your object and spawning the gem but that sounds like a bunny hole nightmare (easier to just make new action I'd imagine). ultimately crafting recipe is probably easiest least pretty solution,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,03/10/2019 4:20 AM,you mean ModelToWorld Position ?,,
380637491029344275,.w00kie#9866,03/10/2019 4:20 AM,thats pretty much I found dunno how to get the components tho/ position```LOD GetLODByName( string name )```,,
