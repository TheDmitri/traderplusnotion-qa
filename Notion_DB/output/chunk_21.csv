179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:27 AM,steam wrokshop or whaterver crap they've pulled identifies the collection of pbos via the cfgmods/ mod.cpp,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,@Jacob_Mango yea sure i saw that as well,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,Except that is not how it works atm,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,wha? it's broken?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,Oh yea -filePatching dose nothing,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,and mod.cpp is not loaded,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:28 AM,aaaaaaah ok,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,-filePatching does work. I use it on a server for unpacked scripts.,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,maybe not for mods it doesn't work,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,"well, you keep saying mod.cpp, but that has been done away with",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,it will work for native enscript that is hardcoded,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,Eg dta/scripts,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,it's ignored,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:29 AM,but not for mods,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:31 AM,"whatever bis did or didn't break, whatever bis think theyre using in a special way but aren''t. the fact is the sole purpose of a 'mod.cpp' is to identifty a collection of pbos",,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:32 AM,and the reason for that is to enable/desable them as an entirety,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:32 AM,it is not file patching as much as bis would like to wish it. nor can it magically turn into file patching or a red tomato,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:34 AM,"and note the words, a *collection* of pbos.  They are often NOT a mod, more like a collection of mods in one package.",,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:41 AM,"and yes folks, I understand why fiepatching is no longer working, but that's just bis being stoopid, it's not, and wasn't the purpose behind mod.cpp (other than bundle the files in an indentifiable mod)",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:44 AM,"Sooo servers not reporting mods they are running, -serverMod is not a thing,  filePatching not working, no documentation on tools. ""We support modding""",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:44 AM,Sure,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:48 AM,That is not the point,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:48 AM,I know they removed it and how to add it,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:48 AM,Not an issue here,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,01/05/2019 7:48 AM,"No, it was relating to the previous conversation about the mod.cpp",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,01/05/2019 7:48 AM,Ahh i miss understood!,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,01/05/2019 7:49 AM,"I thought you were asking how it was done, etc!",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:49 AM,Issue is that i needed to change half of my dev environment due to a fact file patching dosent work since mod.cpp removal,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:49 AM,So i NEED to pack my mods to load them,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:49 AM,And that is quite... Annoying to say at least,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/05/2019 7:50 AM,it shouldn't be annoying?,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,01/05/2019 7:50 AM,ahh ok,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/05/2019 7:50 AM,that's what I've been doing from the very start,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:50 AM,Yea sure but any hotloading goes out of the window at that point,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:50 AM,And that is how i was doing everything,,

I'm facing a problem that I can't find the solution.
I have a custom script that spawns zombies around a player. All the zombies spawned are inserted inside an entityAI array.
Everything works fine, but after some time, it looks like some zombies are bugged, and when I try to get information about bugged zombies, I have a NULL pointer to instance.

Example when I loop the entityAI array : 
```
for (int zombiesSpawned_i = 0; zombiesSpawned_i < zombiesSpawned.Count(); ++zombiesSpawned_i)
{
    EntityAI zmb = zombiesSpawned.Get(zombiesSpawned_i);
    if(zmb.IsAlive()) //NULL pointer here for around 1% of zombies inside the array
    {}
}
```
Is there a way to check if my entityAI object is not corrupt or something before starting to deal with it ?
Thanks",,

I'm trying to create a variant of the barrel with my own 3D model
So i took a look at how the barrel was managed etc... and prepare the config file , vehicles files etc....

But now i want to make it craftable and want to have this line :
AddResult(""Mycustom3dmodelt"");

Or something like that

Is it okay if those codes use the samed pbo addon?
Or should i make one addon that contain all the 3D models
and another Addon that contain all the interactions with the models?

Or can i just write down my crafting code into the config & vehicles files of my 3D models?",,

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 3:47 AM,Use constants.c to make your changes and then repackage inside the scripts.pbo on the server side.,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:30 AM,No. Signatures are checked against server bikeys,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:31 AM,Checking the entire client pbos against the entire server pbos would be very unoptimized I imagine,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:32 AM,the same way,,

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:32 AM,Is it just checking if the bisign file is the same on client and server?,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:33 AM,No. For the technicalities of signature checks @mikero might be able to chime in,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:33 AM,"I would imagine a great deal of it isnt public info, by design",,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:33 AM,"It's alright, I was just curious as to how the server is able to just run a modified version of files and allow clients to join.",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:34 AM,"Because like I said, as far as the verification goes, the server pbos or bisigns arent even involved at all",,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:35 AM,So the client is just compared to an effective master bikey?,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:35 AM,"The server doesnt even have to run the same files as client and verification can still work.

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:37 AM,Assuming such mod didn't require any extra files like new .paa files or .layouts?,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:37 AM,Yes but I dont think yes in the way you are thinking,,

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:38 AM,I'm trying to think of something that could be added that wouldn't require a client-side file for display purposes.,,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:39 AM,Say for example if you were to make the trader mod function as an action (or chat command) and you just added the actions to the servers pbo's would the server not communicate those available actions to the client?,,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:40 AM,"I don't know lmao, I'm just trying to think of a good example lol",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:40 AM,You're *very* limited to what you could do on server without running on client.,,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:41 AM,Would changing the descriptions of items in the server pbo's change them for a client that connects to the server? Or nah,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:41 AM,no,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:41 AM,that kind of data isnt sent to client,,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:41 AM,I see,,
143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:41 AM,But things like blood regen speeds and such would be possible to modify?,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:45 AM,@Scenic changing base destruction will likely break shit if I had to guess,,

179204846019149824,mikero,01/09/2019 5:45 AM,"since you didn't change the bisign, it's the old pbo is 'valid' on the client (as-far-as-the-client-is-concerned)",,

207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:45 AM,"Because the issue with changing things on server, is the client wont agree",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:46 AM,"if you make it take 5 minutes to do the destroy wall animation, the client still thinks it takes 30 seconds (or w/e is default)",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:46 AM,"So when 30 seconds is up, it might boot you from the action I think",,

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:46 AM,I believe the base destruction animation just uses the word cutting animation and repeats it over until the object health is depleted.,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:47 AM,"Yeah but what I mean by animation length, I mean the circle that fills",,

143518784043352066,Scenic#6395,01/09/2019 5:48 AM,But is that an actual animation? Or is it a usage bar similar to how you can watch stamina degrade as you run etc.,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,01/09/2019 5:48 AM,Stamina is another example of something that can be done on server (but shouldnt),,

I'm looking for a way to do something when a zombie die.

If yes, then is there a way to trigger something when a zombie die on the server ?

You cant only copy paste man .. :o

playerEnt = GetGame().CreatePlayer(identity, characterName, spawnPosArray.Get(Math.RandomIntInclusive(0, 70)), 0, ""NONE""); //Creates random player

you are randomly choosing spawns between 0 and 70 but you only defined 0 to 12
