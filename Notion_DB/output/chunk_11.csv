241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:12 AM,This is as far as I take it,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:12 AM,The DoMove FSM state can be expanded,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:12 AM,for collision detection and avoidence,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:12 AM,or hooke dup to a proper pathing system,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:12 AM,but im not doing all that,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,11/18/2018 3:19 PM,theres a SetTarget function i think in the zombie controller,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/18/2018 3:19 PM,but afaik theres not much exposed on the ai side,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,why would they have so driving vehicles,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,because they are lazy asses,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,that's their reasoning behind many things ^,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,and rather copy paste afunction,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,so maybe there is some spare functions in there from the older system,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,not as simple as copy pasting mate,,
135397703759691776,_ayano,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,"im pretty sure they didnt start from scratch with this engine build, they really only cut out what had to be replaced and replaced it",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,i absolutely know,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:21 PM,just saying,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:22 PM,it is built on a2 oa @thurston  as i know,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:23 PM,They used Enforce Engine as the base and merged it with Real Virtuality 3.5 so it would be compatible with DayZ.,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,11/18/2018 3:23 PM,"oh, is it? if that's the case, it sucks that they didn't retain the gunplay from it",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:24 PM,They had to rewrite significant parts of the engine and they also changed the animation system.,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,yeah they did,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,Plus I don't think it was in the developers goal to keep the 0.62 gunplay clunkyness,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,still waiting for that skeleton optimization that they promised,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,where they said they will decrease the bone count from 200+ to around 20,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,They did that?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,did they? like how,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,It's only for distant objects,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:25 PM,ah alright,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:26 PM,thought its gonna be for the player skeleton itself,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:26 PM,Nah,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:26 PM,twentyish bones are damn low amount,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:26 PM,It was just for infected,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:26 PM,So when they were say 200m from the closest player not every bone was being updated,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:27 PM,As no player would see it,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:27 PM,Also past 500m the infected are client side,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:27 PM,Meaning They aren't updated on the server,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/18/2018 3:28 PM,"So the client just says ""here, let's play idle animations""",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/18/2018 3:28 PM,yeah understand,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:09 PM,im 100% sure they have to include some Ai logic in the full release,,

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:13 PM,was just to make it so the AI would head track the player,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/18/2018 7:13 PM,but it was easier to make him walk,,

I'm unsure about the process of setting up, testing and publishing a mod. Without official documentation, from the internet I basically gather 2 main approaches: 
1) Creating a custom mission that can include code that overrides internal functions/classes 
2) Changing scripts themselves and package them into .pbo files to get them back into the game (a rather obscure process for me still) 

Can someone explain to me the differences between these approaches? What would be the preferred way to do it for mods heavily based on scripting and changing internal mechanics? As opposed to let's say more configuration based mods? Also it's not clear to me if changes have to be made on server side, client side or both and how these 2 relate to each other/are synced in general. Would appreciate any enlightment 😃",,

If I wanted to make it so their gun has no recoil, I would need to modify internal functions as no functionality is built for that. A mission cannot do this, only packed PBO mods",,

I got the other idea from looking at the structure of DayZCommunityOfflineMode which is based on a mission template. There is a folder ""patches"" which includes ""DebugMonitor.c"" and ""PluginLifespan.c"", containing classes DebugMonitorPatched and PluginLifespanPatched which apparently override part of the functionality of their parent classes (which seem to be internal). These patched versions get initialized in init.c and used from there. Am I misunderstanding something here?
For the PBO case: Is there some information somewhere on how to correctly package scripts and how to get them into the game? I'd like to try out some things already but first I'd need to know how to even test my stuff ^^",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/19/2018 5:35 PM,"@cbg  COM is a great showcase of the power of a mission file, but those tools will not work in multiplayer, that is why the authors are creating a new version CommunityOnlineTools, that will work in multiplayer. 
With COM, it is not overriding the base game functionality, for those files you specified, they are actually created in the mission, and because COM is a mission file, it can choose to launch different functionality instead. 

Further, with multiplayer, I don't think anyone has figured out how to make the mission file run code on the clients, if it even can. So with missions you would be limited to changing only server-sided code. So custom UI would not be possible.

What you see in COM is the use of ""extended"" in the classes, which works just like any other Object Oriented language for the most part (Not entirely, there are weaknesses in DayZs version).
With PBOs, you also get the ""modded"" tag for classes, which actually overwrite the base game code, causing all of DayZ, even the internal parts, to run your modded code over the original.

I don't know of any tutorials specifically for DayZ yet, but there is a lot of information on this discord spread out that you can dig for! 😄",,
