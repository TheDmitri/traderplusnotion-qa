105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:11 AM,With decent amount of collisions,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:11 AM,Or refractions,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:11 AM,You will get to a point where you will be asking for cores,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:11 AM,I still not taking refraction and suck into account,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:11 AM,not script threads 😛,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:12 AM,That's would be more heavy than RayTracing Haha,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:12 AM,Well it is RayTracing,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:12 AM,I just want a raycast through players,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:13 AM,That is what people did in the past,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:13 AM,and check which type of object is here,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:13 AM,And people hated it,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:13 AM,So I will know if it's window or wall or doors,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:14 AM,Its just annoying from my experience,,

Im not sure that you would even be able to achieve your desired results using the events system but I very well could be wrong, like once you get that working will it even spawn the loot inside of the hardigg?

Using custom usage flags make just your event hardiggs spawn at this position in mapgroupproto, and you have effectively created a relatively manageable loot event thatll have everything in the hardiggs, allow the hardiggs to be looted and used, and offer some customization for different loot layouts",,

172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:01 AM,I just wrote this based on my own script. didn't test it :) but you get the idea.,,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:06 AM,"@Scruffy  Cheers, it seems to have a few extras functions than the one I have, I will check it out and see how I go hopefully it will update in one login.",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:07 AM,"well i use the same modlist.txt to copy the downloaded mod into the Dayz server folder also, hence why modlist contains an ID and a folder name.",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:08 AM,"The point us, you build a string ""MODS_UPDATE"" that has all the mods in it, then run steamcmd once to update them all.",,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:12 AM,"yea the code you have is almost the same as what I use, has mods listed the same in the modslist.txt but the extra I see is there is after the ""for"" function so that maybe the key,.. the snippets im using I found on a pastebin, as I know more about cars then batch for computers..",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:13 AM,"ah ok, yes the key is to build the string of mods to load.  test the code by echoing the steamcmd.exe line instead of running it. and you can see what it'll do",,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:15 AM,"will do, this is a segment of the version im using,

for /f ""tokens=1,2 delims=,"" %%g in %MOD_LIST% do steamcmd.exe +login %SteamLogin% +workshop_download_item 221100 ""%%g"" +quit +cls

Its basically that one line that updates the mods individually.",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:16 AM,yea :) which is very bad idea,,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:16 AM,unless you don't mind steam locking you out of the account for too many logins lol,,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:17 AM,"ikr,.. casual happening for me when the server crashes on startup..",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:18 AM,I also recommend you do this steam mod update in the background 'while' server is running. i run it every 15-30 mins to continually update mods. and only restart server IF there is an update,,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:20 AM,yea that segment runs on server restart as the batch is a monitor and log archival and updater** all in one.,,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:37 AM,"@Scruffy  I did a bit of modification of your code just to suit some parameters I am using Im hoping it will work well, Im yet to test it, here is what I have,

:modupdate
echo Updating Mods From Modslist...
cd %SteamCMDPath%
set ""MODS_UPDATE=""
for /f ""tokens=1,2 delims=,"" %%g in %MOD_LIST% do (
    rem echo ""adding mod %%g""
    set ""MODS_UPDATE=!MODS_UPDATE! +workshop_download_item 221100 %%g""
    set ""MODS_UPDATE=!MODS_UPDATE:~0,-1!""
    )
steamcmd.exe +login %SteamLogin% +force_install_dir %DAYZ_SVR_LOCATION% !MODS_UPDATE!% +quit
cls
echo Mods Updated!
timeout 2 >nul
goto chksvr

If I have missed something let me know.",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:40 AM,"as far as i know, you can't use forceinstal dir on mods",,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:41 AM,"Im able to, it dls the mods to the server steamapps dir as it would if I was to use default steamcmd dir",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:41 AM,"ok cool, looks fine then",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:41 AM,but this won't work while the server is up. so i assume you take server down to download mods?,,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:42 AM,"if you download the mod to the game folder while server is active, it won't work for some mods",,
437028531759874049,_1c3man_,01/06/2020 6:42 AM,"yea server gets shutdown command, then rolls the updates and restarts",,
172949399360503808,__scruffy__,01/06/2020 6:42 AM,ok,,
