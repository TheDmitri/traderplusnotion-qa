I'm not a professional programmer, so if some of the terms here aren't quite correct, please forgive me.

With `ItemBase Nugget` you create a new Object of ItemBase called ""Nugget"". And with `ItemBase.Cast( )` you can convert a Type into another. And `GetInventory().FindAttachment( slot_id )` will look for the Attachment within the slot with a specific ID (slot_id) of the class where you call it... in this case of OH_HydraulicPress.

So you create Nugget und you tell it to be the Gold or the Copper item, that's attached to you Hydraulic Press.

The only difference to the ""original"" is, that ""Nugget"" has only the Functions of ItemBase, because we said, that Nugget is an ItemBase Object. But that is enough, because we want to use some basic ItemBase Functions of Nugget... like GetQuantity or IsInherited.",,

- And I would recommend to use a editor, that can handle .csv a little better. You could use Excel or any open source counter part. Maybe your stringtable is not correct.
There is (nearly) empty stringtable bohemia provides - use this as basis:
https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Samples/tree/master/Test_Stringtable
- In config, use $ in script, use #.
- you don't need to specify the stringtable in config
- always use complete stringtable - so if you can't translate a language, give it the original text or someone that plays with this language will have no text.

185896664110727168,osodirty,08/22/2022 4:03 AM,Pretty much. Casting to another Type to use it's methods.,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/22/2022 4:04 AM,that is it‚Äôs primarily function yes. But only if the two are related in some way. It also helps ‚Äòmap‚Äô that new entity/variable so that it doesn‚Äôt get ‚Äòlost‚Äô in memory. improper casting can result in NULL returns.. or delays in queries of said entity.,,

Does Super call the function one level of inheritance down or does it call the ""first one"" ... basically the one without override?

So I want to insert a check `canplacelock()` somewhere where I can stop a code lock from placing if `canplacelock()` returns false. I am just learning so I'm probably targeting the wrong method.  I gather from your response that overriding itembase doesn't make sense and it would help me to hear from you the downside to that approach.,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/23/2022 4:50 AM,Only put that method in classes that should be effected. ItemBase effects ALL objects. If there is a code lock base.

Is there someway for me to access that even though I don't have the source code? Modding for Valheim for example its possible to decompile any mod to access its methods. If that is not possible for dayz, my thinking was, I have to target a method that the mod uses -- albeit it I take your point that the target should be at the highest level possible.",,

I've watched Spurgle which has a lot of good info (especially for initial test server set up) but as far as I've seen he doesn't address c/c++ scripting in any detail. I also watched Sneaky Kitty which had some good scripting info. <https://www.youtube.com/c/SneakyKittyGameDev/search>.  I also found some useful stuff in these videos. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcsFFERKcDip3Br5gHzKKg>. If there are any other good tutorials, please send them my way. I'm particularly confused about the trickiness that flows from the organization of the base code into numbered folders instead of a namespace.  Wardog explains it here. <https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/492295576470290433/896073238474555452> I also watched videos by this guy lynch about how to set up the workbench with mikero's tools. I'm not going to link to it because I think those videos may be a bit outdated. I ended up going in circles a bit with those. Also the examples on this github are really helpful <https://dayzmodding.dev/en/Mod-Code-Bases>. All this said -- I wish that I had started with DaemonForge's Earplugs tutorial as it is especially informative. <https://github.com/daemonforge/DayZ-EarPlugs> and I wish that I had found out about Dabs fixscripts.bat sooner.  https://github.com/InclementDab/DayZ-Utilities.",,üëåüèª (1)

I believe this is what Zedmag is pointing me to. ```requiredAddons is the most important setting, because it defines initialization order of addons. If addon B requires addon A, then it will be loaded only once A is loaded as well. This is extremely crucial for making sure Class Inheritance works as intended. If an addon is using some assets from addon C (e.g., textures, sounds, etc.), it is a good practice to make C a required addons```<https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/CfgPatches>.  Thanks Zedmag.",,

I am 100% green to modding in DayZ (have modded other games and am a coder by trade). I am trying to do a relatively basic mod (I think) of a placeable well. I plan on using the well from dayZ either the yellow or blue I don't care. 

Currently I am just trying to get a direct copy of the well, I can get the model to spawn in offline mode via the community tools, but it doesn't allow me to interact with it at all. I dug into it the DZ files and found all of the original .cpp files referencing the model(s) and the associated .c files with the corresponding class names (attached for reference ""pumpConfig.cpp""). I also copied the .c file which just seemed to extend the class as a Well (also attached ""pumpScript.c"").

I have also attached my config.cpp at the root and my config.cpp at my /structures folder.

Also of note, eliminating the last ‚Äúhealthlevels‚Äù value in the damage system class in configs only seems to visually prevent the item from displaying that it‚Äôs ‚Äúruined‚Äù as it still enters a state that causes it not to function, in the case of a firearm anyway.  Appears to have something to do with the scripting side still controlling the state, and possibly in addition to what you mentioned, the IsRuined() and IsDamageDestroyed() parameters.  I didn‚Äôt test if a server will still clean it up on restart but I assume it will since it still went to a state where it‚Äôs being marked as destroyed.  Back to the drawing board. The reverse engineering continues, maybe.",,
