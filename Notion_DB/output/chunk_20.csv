234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 4:50 AM,whats the correct method to check if a player has some item equiped ? for example if player has Mountain Backpack do xy,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 4:50 AM,but only if he has it on his back not if its in his hands or somewhere in the inventory,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 5:20 AM,But i guess the PlayerBase.FindAttachmentBySlotName() is looking for an attachment inside the playerbase,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 5:20 AM,basically something like eyewear,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:10 PM,@GravityWolf i will look at that JsonFileLoader thanks!,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:10 PM,"Yeah, I believe timeslice is time between ticks.",,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:16 PM,@GravityWolf I got another question. how do i know what is executed on the server and what is executed on the client? im implementing some kind of damage over time effect. Right now i basically count the timeslice of the MissionServer::OnUpdate() Method. if that is greater or equal to lets say 2 seconds I update the player health. This does work but to me it looks like its the wrong approach. Im thinking about putting it into the PlayerBase?,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:17 PM,Now is PlayerBase Code Executed on the Server if called from within the MissionServer::OnUpdate() Method?,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:17 PM,"Client for Player base, and On update is server",,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:18 PM,"Think of what you put in a pbo, and what just stays on your server. That's how I've been treating it.",,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:19 PM,Wait. Right now everything is in my pbo. I thought to be able to distribute a mod i need to have everything inside my pbo?,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:19 PM,Well i guess i will keep it inside the MissionServer::OnUpdate() Method,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:19 PM,or at least inside the MissionServer Class,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:20 PM,"Well first off the Objects name is MissionServer, so it's definitely not something the client needs.",,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:20 PM,Yeah i get what you mean but how would i distribute that then?,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:20 PM,Github,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:20 PM,do i have a pbo for the server and a pbo for the client?,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:20 PM,no no,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:21 PM,i mean my client gets a pbo with his PlayerBase code etc,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,01/03/2019 6:21 PM,Yeah,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:21 PM,and my server needs the MissionServer files,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:21 PM,so do i make one pbo with the MissionServer and one pbo with the Client Code?,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:23 PM,to me it seems to be easier to just pack everything in 1 pbo and give it to the Server and the client. I mean i dont care if the client has some code that he does not execute,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/03/2019 6:23 PM,or am i wrong?,,

466716793306873867,bangaladore,01/04/2019 12:04 AM,"Just a heads up to everyone here who needs access to player info at longer ranges, as I said earlier, DayZ has a network bubble which means your client does not know anything about players more than ~1000 meters away from you. The reason why is say this is It was suggested to me by a couple people last night that simply sending the PlayerBase from the server to a client who wants to track a player is sufficient and allows you to grab a players position always. This is incorrect, however it does allow you to track a players position in realtime without the use of extensive RPCs (YAY for server performance) at distances less than the network bubble,  but the moment that player leaves the network bubble, all their information stops updating. @NiiRoZz",,

142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:27 AM,As there are several systems for playing it.,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:28 AM,the only thing that im thinking about is that PlayerBase.PlaySoundEvent is probably not heard by other players,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:28 AM,That way is a synchronized anim event sound system,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:28 AM,since the client exectutes that,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:28 AM,executes,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:28 AM,PlaySoundSet is not auto synchronized.,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:29 AM,No it's not heard because the cough symptom plays it on the server,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:29 AM,You're executing it on the client,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:30 AM,Bypassing the syncing dayz devs have implemented for that anim event system,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:30 AM,wait now im confused,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:30 AM,so right now im doing an rpc from server to client and the client does PlayerBase.PlaySoundEvent,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:31 AM,im thinking this is therefore only heard by the receiving client,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:31 AM,am i right?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:31 AM,You don't need to. I'm pretty sure that system already syncs it to players when called on the server,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:31 AM,But yes to your question,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:32 AM,well when i executed it on the server i never heard the cough sound,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:32 AM,well maybe i just did something wrong in the implementation,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:32 AM,could be,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:32 AM,It's most likely actually the symptom system being synchronized,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:33 AM,That then allows for the sounds to play to all clients in bubble,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:33 AM,Nvm. Yea you can just send rpcs,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:34 AM,so the PlaySoundEvent is not synchronized?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:35 AM,Not entirely sure. Cant remember. I don't think that particular function is but there's more to it i think,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:35 AM,Do you know a synchronized method?,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:35 AM,well im changing it right now to play on the server i will know it in a few seconds,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:39 AM,i mean some standard way,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:39 AM,What's the context,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:39 AM,the context is that if a player enters a specific area without proper equipment he starts coughing,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:39 AM,What are you trying to do. Why the coughing?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:40 AM,Ahh,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/04/2019 4:40 AM,right now i use the missionServer on Update to check if a player is in the zone. if soe i check his equipment. if its not meeting the requirement i sent a rpc from server to client to play the cough sound,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:44 AM,Yea. idk theres only Soundonvehicle that is actually synced but i think it's depreciated,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:44 AM,It still works tho,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,01/04/2019 4:44 AM,But it uses cfgsounds,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 2:31 AM,just a missed edge case,,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/05/2019 2:31 AM,but the item is still referenced in the array,,
466716793306873867,bangaladore,01/05/2019 2:31 AM,man it would be useful to be able debug the GC,,

234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/05/2019 2:31 AM,it should not collect,,

179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:10 AM,"folks, you are dealing with addons. In the bis engine. there's no such thing as c:\steam, c:\my documents or indeed c:\anything. The bis engine looks for *everything* starting at \

The \ is the root of  of a linux file system, and,  to emulate that you create a virtual drive. In dayz, that drive is popualarly called z:\ (in arma, it's the P:\  drive)

Every single addon you ever make is on that drive. No ifs, buts, or maybes.
and every single pbo YOU make should be in

Z:\mytag

z:\mytag is the place where no other person making an addon can collide with what you are doing. Thus:

z:\mytag\MyM16   is a different animal to

z:\hisTag\MyM16. there is no collission because the folder is different.

thus, you endup with:

z:\mytag\Mytank
z:\mytag\MyScripts
z:\mytag\MyRifle

And, usung pboProject or addon breaker, you end up with

myScripts.pbo
myRifle.pbo and, 
MyTank.pbo

-----

the same rules apply for bis.

schock and horror, guess what's inside

z:\Scripts",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:12 AM,Do they actually create a drive or do they just emulate it?,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:15 AM,Thats quite fucked up way of dealing with file paths,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:15 AM,:feelshmm:,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:17 AM,"true and not true, it's actually a lot cleaner. You are never ever in any doubt where your files are, they are on z:\. Not in think of a number, and it's wednesday coz i felt like it. they are on Z:",,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:19 AM,"where the game engine is (in steam) where savefiles are (in userapp god-knows) where, the rpt file is (in appdata) is immaterail, *every-single-asset used by the engine is on Z:\",,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:19 AM,Well z: drive is just an abstraction. It can be any folder / place. that whole thing with junctions is due to a fact you cant load unpacked data,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,and im fairly sure they broke that with mod.cpp change,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,as mod.cpp was prompting config.cpp load,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,it can't be a folder. but you are right otherwise,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,Witch loaded the rest,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,"it has to be a virgin, blank drive (which does indeed point to a folder)",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:20 AM,Yea fair enough,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:21 AM,"as for mod.cpp, bis have shot themselves in the foot by removing it.",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:21 AM,And me as well,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:21 AM,As im fairly sure this button is so flaky because of that,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/530994311442202624/unknown.png,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:21 AM,"it's easy enough to put a class cfgMods inside your config.cpp, but it's not, what was actually needed.",,
234386140780691457,langeweilezug,01/05/2019 7:22 AM,im fairly new what is/was the deal with mod.cpp?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:22 AM,It was a config entry point wasent it ?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:22 AM,And now that its gone,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:22 AM,:sadpepe: ðŸ”«,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:22 AM,all mod.cpps were aggregated internally by the engine into a class cfgMods,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,now. bis expect you to do that for them (in the config.cpp),,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,Well it wasent just that,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,Im fairly sure that that mod.cpp was always loaded even unpacked,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,being compiled then prompting config cpp load etc,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,it was,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:23 AM,Now that is gone nothing is looked at unpacked,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,it identifies the MOD,,

179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,ummmm?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,You cant load anything unpacked anymore,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,you need to pack it in a PBO to load it,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,correct,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:24 AM,correct and this is a bad bad ba d mistiake on bi's part,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:25 AM,As it makes their idea on how to use Workbench not work,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,01/05/2019 7:25 AM,a mod.cpp is used to load unpacked PBO's,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:25 AM,nooooooooooooooooooo,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:25 AM,it merely identifies a collection of pbos,,
179204846019149824,mikero,01/05/2019 7:26 AM,just as cfgPatches indentifes A pbo,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,01/05/2019 7:26 AM,oddly it was the only thing that was loaded unpacked...,,
