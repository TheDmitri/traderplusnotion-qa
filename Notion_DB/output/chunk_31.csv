148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/20/2019 10:35 AM,You need to convert the memory position to the player model position,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,05/20/2019 10:35 AM,(I think),,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:35 AM,but he is attaching this to the gun....,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,*pipe,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,pipe...where is this pipe gonna be?,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,in the mouth 😄,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,it should work then,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,does not matter,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,if the obj goes in inventory then the position might bug out,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:36 AM,and start to go off from feet of player,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:37 AM,if so...just add safety checks to kill particle of in inventory :peepoOkay: use the same way devs do it.,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:38 AM,`class RoadFlare` is a great example,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:38 AM,"ok so it works, but the thing is that when i equip it to the face the particle goes to the ground.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,thats exactly what i said. face = inventoyr,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,that why @Jacob_Mango said it wont work,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,so when it goes back to inv...it needs to use a mem point froma players face,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,aah,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,in this case you are in a pickle,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,fuck,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:39 AM,or just guess the position.....but you cant...since it wont 'attach'....,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:40 AM,what are the mem points for the player? is there a mouth one? thought i saw that somewhere,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:40 AM,or is it a secret no one knows 😄,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 10:41 AM,best thing you could do rn...is look at devs memes for a solid understanding,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:42 AM,"yeah im familiar with this, could use the head bone",,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:43 AM,like getbonepos + offsetforthepipe,,
402077901174079499,munghard,05/20/2019 10:44 AM,so this is why i originally said the mempoints dont really work 😄,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 12:16 PM,Yea you could make some sort of function to check if the mod is not loaded then skip adding X attributes to player,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/20/2019 12:18 PM,Actually...if the mod is not there....you should be fine....the data saved for your stuff should be ignored....,,

I really have little confidence in the reliability of enscript to record pointers correctly in another element that uses ""ref"". In the sense that if it is not indicated when creating the variable, it takes the pointer wrong even if elsewhere in the code you specify the ""ref"" well, after that, that's my opinion, I'm more and more suspicious as I code with this thing. 😂",,

349108696275484683,Cheese bukkake#6687,06/03/2019 8:37 PM,so to make a stamina mod I would have to make my own mod and make the clients download it too,,

349108696275484683,Cheese bukkake#6687,06/03/2019 8:39 PM,Well youl know but il work a fix. The only way around it is just to have your own mod pack for server,,

349108696275484683,Cheese bukkake#6687,06/03/2019 8:40 PM,It goes down really slow and that but you can still hold breath for like 15-20 seconds,,

349108696275484683,Cheese bukkake#6687,06/03/2019 8:40 PM,Because weight doesent effect your stamina so I wanted to increase the holdbreath drain slightly,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,06/03/2019 8:40 PM,Ah. Well in that case yes you'll want to make your own mod. It should be easy now that constant modding is a thing,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:38 AM,😡,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:39 AM,damnit. i always hated whitespacing with no bracket structure,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:39 AM,"and from there...

have a false bool at the start that you can set to true if one of your cases is met, then after the switch, if the bool is set true return super (if it's inside OnKeyPress())",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:41 AM,(unless you want the key to still go through to other code still as well),,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:41 AM,actually... nevermind I redact that,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:41 AM,yeah i think that's a bit over redundant,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:41 AM,with the enter and escape keys that's a bad idea,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:42 AM,"i'm new to enforce, honestly just wish there was proper documentation, i've seen a few wikis but they're incomplete.",,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:43 AM,my screen was from the docs :p,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:43 AM,"also another thing to complain about is casting, who the hell casts using an extension method",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,06/05/2019 10:43 AM,Mine is the most incomplete of them all :)),,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:44 AM,well to make it work well in c# you do a lot of tryparse extensionmethods. I like it 😃,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:44 AM,i like explicit casting,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:44 AM,ye its a bit against the c# design though where you try to avoid runtime errors,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:47 AM,or actually it would be nice with a ``as`` keyword,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:48 AM,would save my fingers some energy..,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:49 AM,since you jump so much in the hierarchy up n down,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:49 AM,"something like
```
Object o = (variable as Object)
```",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:49 AM,or `is`,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:50 AM,"```c
Object o;
EntityAI source;
Class.CastTo(o, source);```",,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:51 AM,ye when declaring new variables I'm not to picky.,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 10:51 AM,Class.CastTo is a reasonably clean implementation,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:51 AM,but like ```DoStuff(source as PlayerBase)```,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:52 AM,"yeah, but it's an extension method and it just bloats as you continue to cast more and more objects",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 10:52 AM,just generally makes statements longer,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 10:55 AM,easy to read > short statements,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:00 AM,"I don't mind typing more, as long as it works",,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:02 AM,ye I'm enjoining every moment of the scripting. Just some intellisence missing and it would be 👌,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:03 AM,I'm still using notepad++,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:03 AM,vscode here..,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:03 AM,a form of intellisense is present in the workshop script editor apparently,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:04 AM,but I haven't been able to decipher what we're supposed to do to set it all up properly,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:04 AM,It picks up from  outside of the file you are in?,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,06/05/2019 11:04 AM,"I use the workbench, it's helped me by making it easier to reload scripts.",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:04 AM,I'd love it if someone who has worked it out could do a tute video from the start of how to set it up,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,06/05/2019 11:09 AM,"@Cleetus, how does after 11:30am sound on this day in the picture?",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/585756961807794186/unknown.png,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:09 AM,sounds great to me,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:09 AM,😃,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:10 AM,I think it would be really helpful to all scripters and modders in general,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:10 AM,"oh you where talking about the scripteditor. 
Ye that has intellisence by default",,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:10 AM,but the enforced gui setup blows my brains out,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:11 AM,not that I am complaining about notepad++... I love it,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:11 AM,I just want to use that darn step-through debugging lol,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:11 AM,I love how everything is drag n drop as well.. or mostly drag..,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:12 AM,the docs describes it pretty well now.,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:12 AM,since mid of May..,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:12 AM,I know it was something I must have done wrong,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:12 AM,getting (!) <--- this one?,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,or does it not load the mod,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,doesn't see the folders I told it to,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,so the files aren't even showing lol,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,You pulled COT yeah?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,yeah,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,06/05/2019 11:13 AM,"if so, try `P:\JM\COT\Scripts\Workbench\Batchfiles\RunWorkbench.bat`",,Retardpepe (1)
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 11:14 AM,will give that a try,,

94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:18 AM,everything you do just works huh? 😄,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 11:18 AM,not really. WB is actually better than using any other text editors. Loading mods into it is even more simple than setting up mods for a server. its legit the same shit.,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 11:19 AM,:HMM:,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:19 AM,Nah far from it,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 11:22 AM,🤔 well it did take me a few sessions until i got used to WB debugging....but i don't think there is room for any more major features. Maybe fixes for some annoying bugs (the breakpoint) other than that....its works :peepoOkay:,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 11:22 AM,a video tut would be useful yea....:HMM:,,

94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:23 AM,I cant go backwards.. Its to late for me,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:23 AM,I rather skip the intellisence,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 11:24 AM,"and  I need smooth jumping. 
but its not fair compairing it to vscode",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,06/05/2019 12:05 PM,i just skip using the workbench unless i'm creating a layout,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:05 PM,same at the moment,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:06 PM,find in files and my custom setup syntax highlighting works for me for the most part,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:06 PM,but the debugger would be nice to use,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:06 PM,😛,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:07 PM,I got the COT one going that Jacob pointed me towards,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 12:07 PM,so I guess I'll go over that and hopefully work it out from there haha,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 12:16 PM,I use script-editor for debugging,,
94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 12:17 PM,and vscode for the rest,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,06/05/2019 12:55 PM,vscode ftw,,

94846990000594944,QuickZ#5873,06/05/2019 12:57 PM,vscode have it as well and seams faster,,
