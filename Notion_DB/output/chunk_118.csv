The particles will spawn on the client's side and even if you move away from the deleted zone for several km and return back, the particles still lie in place.

It turns out that the particles does not have a ""network bubble"" like the rest of the entities and they always exist on the client.

This is a vanilla method of creating particles for the contaminated zone on the client

```cs
        //class EffectArea
    void OnParticleAllocation(ParticleManager pm, array<ParticleSource> particles)  
    {
        foreach (ParticleSource p : particles)
        {
            if (p.GetOwner() == this) // Safety, since it can be unrelated particles when done through event
                m_ToxicClouds.Insert(p);
        }
    }
```

I solved the problem with the remaining particles in this way

```cs

modded class EffectArea
{
    override void OnParticleAllocation(ParticleManager pm, array<ParticleSource> particles)
    {
        foreach (ParticleSource p : particles)
        {
            if (p.GetOwner() == this)
            {
                m_ToxicClouds.Insert(p);
            }
            else
            {
                p.Stop();
            }
        }
    }
}

Recently, I cleaned my system disk from garbage, and decided to move the folder with the unpacked game files to disk D, deleted the old one, pointed to the new folder on disk D in dez tools, unpacked the files there, and when packing the pborpoject mod, it gives the following error, before that when I packed the same mod and the game files were on disk C, then there were no errors, maybe I forgot to change something in the paths somewhere, please help me

My intent is to find all the positions of radio towers once so I can store their positions. Since they are static map objects, they never move unless the server moves them so I only have to run this once in a while.",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,03/31/2022 2:50 PM,Have a look at the functions surrounding `FilterObstructedObjectsByGrouping` in `\scripts\4_World\Static\MiscGameplayFunctions.c`. Maybe it would be easiest to override `IsObjectObstructedEx` or `IsObjectObstructedFilter` if you want to make it per item. If you want to override the behavior for ALL kind of items you could modify the constants in `VicinityItemManager` found at `\scripts\5_Mission\GUI\InventoryNew\VicinityItemManager.c`. Here is how to modify them: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax#Modded_constants,,

When calling `SetHeader` it is possible to escape the original Content-Type string that is padded to the object and essentially trick libcurl in the engine. Dont ask how we figured this out, its ugly. Either way, start your header with `\r\n` and then follow it with your custom header entry. Between each custom header, add `\r\n` once more to break them up. Finally at the end it is nessecary to add `Content-Type: application/json` since it is no longer automatically set by the SetHeader function. Without these steps you will get a 400 error.
