244647583576883200,valdark2,09/22/2018 10:56 PM,So if I wanted a string of pant types for each class I’d be making a subclass of pants for those pants then calling that within the other class.

107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/23/2018 8:04 PM,Yeah it's fairly complex,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:33 AM,well we were planning on doing something like that,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:33 AM,with COM,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:33 AM,but not on the current system,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:34 AM,we were betting that the server sends over the custom mission to the client but that logically wouldnt make sense,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:34 AM,since the server uses missionServer,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:34 AM,makes me even wonder if they even intend on doing that,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:34 AM,or if they're just gonna push it all to steamworkshop,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:34 AM,one less thing to code amr....,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,gotta push 1.0 by end of year,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,It's intended to send a mission.c file to the client,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,Not the Init.c,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,Where would that mission.c be,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,mission.c IS init.c,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,But might ben scraped,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,trust,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,some reason when you write the file path using print,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,its called mission.c,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:35 AM,The file is still called cur_mp./missionname.world/mission.c,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:36 AM,U don't send Mission server to a client,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:36 AM,Else anyone could steal ur code,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:36 AM,unless this is jsut because i was testing in offline mode,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,And it wouldn't work,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,Cuz it's Server side code,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,"i did a full system search and could not find that file. it must be created in memory if it exists at all. I had already tried creating a mission.c and it didn't work for a server. Also, the mission path it apparently reads from is `mpmissions\__cur_mp.chernarusplus\mission.c`",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,he said that,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,The client runs GameplayMission regardless so I think there must be a way to send one from the server to the client. Would make absolutely no sense to only be able to modify client sided missions by modding,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,when u try to play another mission using PlayMission(),,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/24/2018 10:37 AM,"nah, slight difference if it matters which it could",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,it works,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,@Kerkkoh u can edit anything by modding,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,That's not the problem,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,But the problem is without modding,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,"I know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. What I mean is that it would make no sense to be able to ONLY do it via modding.",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:38 AM,missionGameplay is what you'd need to send over to the client,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:39 AM,since its the only thing the game can swap to without having to relaunch the game,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:39 AM,unlike a mod,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/24/2018 10:39 AM,Hopefully they tell us the intentions in this weeks status report,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:39 AM,yea,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:39 AM,otherwise,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:40 AM,u could say make an admin tool mod. give it to only admins to be able to send rpcs to do things,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:40 AM,whilst normal players wouldnt need it,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,but the server would reject anyone not using the mod anyway right,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,Only if u tell the server to do so,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,Allowed mods / required mods,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,verifySignatures makes sure everyone has the same files tho right?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,ah,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:41 AM,yea how would you do that in dayz,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:42 AM,Verify signatures is just to check the files. Of client vs the key files,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:42 AM,yea,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:42 AM,Server side files can differ too,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:42 AM,Without breaking the key,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:43 AM,You can also distro the mod to everyone and just have the server check the rpcs against let's say an array of steamids so only admins will be able to use the tool.,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:43 AM,Unless I'm terribly wrong.,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:43 AM,but the point is,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:43 AM,we dont want to have to give everyone a mod,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,Ah alright.,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,if its just an admin tool mod it makes no sense to give it to normal players. since its really only for rpc sending,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,"I just want to have User interactions in the Mission, similiar to arma",,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,Add menu to objects etc,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,yea,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 10:44 AM,Yeap..,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:45 AM,but its fairly simple to add ur own user interacts on client side,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:45 AM,Also a way to render 2d/3d space text,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:45 AM,idk about server side tho,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:45 AM,they have a scriptedwidgeteventhandler for that,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:46 AM,Works only client-side,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 10:46 AM,U can't open menus from server-side,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:46 AM,well yea UI's are done client side,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:47 AM,this is why i think it will be limited compared to arma 3,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:47 AM,hm,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:47 AM,cant it be possible,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:48 AM,to serialize a layoutfile and send it over to the client to open?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:48 AM,i dont see why not,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:48 AM,the problem would be actually opening the file. having the function written on client side to dothat,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 10:48 AM,which sending a custom missiongameplay over would solve that,,

105784568346324992,x39,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,there was a sources leak?,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,Take on Mars got a enf script dll,,
105784568346324992,x39,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,not even noticed tbh,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,yea awhile ago,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,With all functions exported,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,So u don't need source for that one,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,its why we have 420 servers now,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 4:18 PM,and all that stuff,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:22 PM,Cancer,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:23 PM,"U should have said, it's bi 's fault that we got the servers so late and had to desperately save the game by hacking the game",,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 4:23 PM,Cough,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 4:25 PM,:Hellmo:,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,09/24/2018 4:26 PM,maybe its just my experience but i honestly dont feel as if they should cop shit for the way things turned out,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 5:46 PM,@X39 Look at the core and gamelib folders,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 6:55 PM,So how would you guys go about adding a godmode? I was thinking of just healing all players with a variable on tick but I feel like that might be a little bit too much strain on the server,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 6:56 PM,Is there a onDamage event handler somewhere?,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 6:57 PM,"there is a processhit method which applies at least to AI, player and fall damage",,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 6:58 PM,which still wouldnt make you invulnerable to modifier damage I guess,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 6:58 PM,Uhmm where can I find that,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 6:59 PM,ctrl f on all files in Scripts and search for processhit if your editor can do that,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 6:59 PM,Ah okay,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 7:00 PM,ah nvm the method I meant is called EEHItBy,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 7:00 PM,found in playerbase.c,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,09/24/2018 7:09 PM,"Oh, yeah, I wonder if I just take that out for people with god mode, would that disable their damage",,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/24/2018 7:13 PM,"some of it, I ve seen a method call AddHealth to base value (or SetHealth to set absolute values) which also can add negative health and works for most modifiers",,
105783453345161216,sgtvulkan,09/24/2018 7:39 PM,"Ive tried using allowDamage onto my player client even with a serverside rpc but it doesnt seem to work with zombie hits and fall damage, havent tested with players though. The best I can think of is each players client receiving a tick for upping health ect, but it wont stop headshot death and great falls will still kill. And like you said, would be a fair bit of strain.",,
105783453345161216,sgtvulkan,09/24/2018 7:40 PM,If u do figure out a way let me know 😁,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:50 PM,allowdamage is disabled,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:50 PM,for the same reason execEnscript is,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:50 PM,both are disabled in the engine,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 7:56 PM,So where do I put performance intensive scripts?,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 7:56 PM,When threads don't work,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:57 PM,In the trash where the belong? *Baduum tish*,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:58 PM,"But seriously though, is it possible to move those scripts to be event based?",,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:58 PM,That could be a good alternate,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 7:59 PM,Otherwise I'm not sure. There is probably something similar to a threading system somewhere. It wouldn't make much sense to not have one,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:00 PM,I have to do smth 750 times,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:00 PM,Thread keyword is broken,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:00 PM,It freezes the main thread,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:01 PM,I'll try script module jwo,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:01 PM,Now,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:01 PM,Bur engine calls are probably single threaded,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:02 PM,Event based it would take long to do it,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:02 PM,But yeah,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:02 PM,It's just a initial cost,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/24/2018 8:03 PM,After that every 10 seconds doing 0-20 things,,

DayZServer\<Mod Name>\Addons\<all addons + bisigns>
DayZServer\<Mod Name>\Keys\<bikeyname>.bikey (public bikey created by your .privatebikey)

474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:13 PM,Hi new here and to modding,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:13 PM,Is there somewhere I can findout more about how the mods are actaully called? I know you need the param for the client and the server but is there an equivalent main function/required files or something?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:33 PM,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/452040757134491648/491857513327755274/DayZ.zip,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:34 PM,it's fairly complex to get into modding at this stage,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:34 PM,there are no official tools or documentation,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:35 PM,unless you have some previous programming experience or REALLY want to learn it's worth waiting until mod tools officially release,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:36 PM,but if you want to see what to do check out that zip,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:41 PM,@CaptainCookie If you have any questions feel free to send me a pm,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:42 PM,"This is great, thanks",,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:43 PM,👌,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:43 PM,I've got some past experience. Its more of the why then the how atm for me.,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:43 PM,ah sweet,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:43 PM,its a bit of a mess right now lol,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:44 PM,such as mod.cpp having dependencies for game world and mission but this mod only has world,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:44 PM,you can change those lol,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:44 PM,the dependencies also influence load order,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:45 PM,ah right so you call them in that order even if you don't have anything for that section?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:45 PM,yeah,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:45 PM,basicially that makes your mod load last,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:46 PM,right I see ^^,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:46 PM,You can also make your own script modules as well,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:46 PM,You familiar with OOP cookie?,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:47 PM,for the most part yes 😛,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:49 PM,Yeah Enforce is Object orientated,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/24/2018 11:50 PM,I think my biggest block with this is just trying to understand the flow of how it works. For example when is the customfppcamera.c content called?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:50 PM,yeah,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:51 PM,The customcamera is called whever the first person camera function is called,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:52 PM,the modded prefix tells the engine that you want to modify a class,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:52 PM,when you use the modded prefix you don,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:52 PM,"'t override the whole class, you just add/change stuff in the class",,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:53 PM,this lets you add your own functions to classes,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:53 PM,such as that constructor for the dayzcam,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:54 PM,effectively that mod adds a constructor function that gets called whenever a first person camera is created,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:54 PM,"let's say a constructor function already existed, then you would want to use the override keyword to replace it",,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:55 PM,If you want to find out when some code gets executed you have to trace it in the source files,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:55 PM,or spam print statements,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:55 PM,that works too,,
196085104123052032,mka0207,09/24/2018 11:55 PM,Where do Prints show up?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/24/2018 11:56 PM,scripts.log,,
196085104123052032,mka0207,09/24/2018 11:58 PM,"I cant find the scripts.log, I have everything enabled to log and I cant seem to see it.",,
196085104123052032,mka0207,09/25/2018 12:00 AM,Nvm I found out.,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,09/25/2018 12:00 AM,server_profile\\script.log 😃,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/25/2018 12:02 AM,Oh right I see DayZPlayerCamera1stPerson is a game function,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,09/25/2018 12:02 AM,Gotcha,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 12:10 AM,DayZPlayerCamera1stPerson is a class,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 12:11 AM,All that the mod does is create a constructor function (A function that runs when the class is created),,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 12:12 AM,So everytime you toggle into first person It creates the camera object which runs the function,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 1:56 AM,sooo has anyone some signed mod I can test? Just want to know if my signing is wrong or its some strange server behavior on my machine ^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 2:06 AM,"okkk thats strange: I packed and signed a mod from another person. on my server and client I dont have my trader.pbo anymore but it still kicks me with: ""modified data: addons/trader.pbo""",,
244647583576883200,valdark2,09/25/2018 2:09 AM,You accidentally pack into your base adding folder?,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 2:12 AM,i dont know if i should laught or cry.. xD,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 2:13 AM,oh no it was ClientDayz/Addons not Server sry.. 😏,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 2:13 AM,you just have to talk to yourself in chat and all problems will solve themself 😄,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,09/25/2018 2:17 AM,NVM IT WORKS!!! 😊,,

107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:25 AM,I wonder if override works on constants LOL,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:25 AM,why haven't I tested this,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:25 AM,I doubt it but you never know,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:26 AM,Then suddenly having all the stamina constants as global would make more sense lol,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/25/2018 3:39 AM,It does not work,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/25/2018 3:39 AM,"You can’t, pretty sure Keegan tested this",,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:52 AM,yeah,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,09/25/2018 3:52 AM,I didn't think it would tbh,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:39 AM,"@Jezithyr  yeah, you get a multiple declarations of variable error",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:39 AM,"but by all means try it yourself. Maybe a small tweak that you do will force it to work

who knows 🤔 its dayz",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:55 AM,Hey guys,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,Yeah the holograms are semi transparent. You can see behind the model when placing them down.it,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,Wondering what BI has planned for the building system.,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,How they will place objects.,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,Holograms?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,Yeah when you place a fireplace,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:57 AM,Or generator,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:58 AM,Not sure,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,09/25/2018 5:58 AM,"I'm guessing if you look at what is called when placing a fireplace, you will see what they name the preview object.  Then search if there is one for the gates or watchtower.",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:58 AM,Okay,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:58 AM,@Jacob_Mango,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:58 AM,What do you mean?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,there is a map uI,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,does it work?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,Oh yeah,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,That works,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,But you can't modify it,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,does it show the player?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,And I don't think you can place markers or get information from it. Haven't tested it out,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,No it doesn't show the player,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/25/2018 5:59 AM,:/,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 6:00 AM,I was gonna make a spawn selection screen based off it,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 6:00 AM,But I abandoned that idea ages ago,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/25/2018 6:00 AM,Just gonna focus on getting this new inventory,,

148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/25/2018 5:02 PM,The floor is the terrain floor not a objects floor afaik so be wary,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/25/2018 5:02 PM,And check if it's really a cgame function,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/25/2018 5:02 PM,Or a global function,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,09/25/2018 5:03 PM,If it's glvosl u don't need getgame,,
225213515030331392,TigerSnake#0609,09/25/2018 5:04 PM,yeah I've tried using the function just on it's own and it's telling me it's undefined,,

295660175237447691,sentepu,09/25/2018 6:34 PM,i renamed the scripts.pbo to make it use the folder and added a print without success,,
295660175237447691,sentepu,09/25/2018 6:35 PM,"so i think im gonna go with the proper way of modding by creating another folder and following paths, i was just lazy",,

295660175237447691,sentepu,09/25/2018 6:38 PM,it's already an override method there,,
295660175237447691,sentepu,09/25/2018 6:39 PM,even if its the dirty way i dont get why it doesnt work,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/25/2018 6:39 PM,but 305 is exactly the line where it says this branch is not used,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/25/2018 6:40 PM,because its called on server anyway,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,09/25/2018 6:40 PM,did you try it offline?,,
