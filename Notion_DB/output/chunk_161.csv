It works for items with its own cargo (like barrel), but it doesn't work for attachments

I'm trying to attach a jacket/pants to a custom item, but its inventory is still visible
Moreover, it breaks the UI  of a parent item (wrong item name, wrong cargo item name)

Found your issue here which is closed due to duplicate: https://feedback.bistudio.com/T160303
And the original issue is still open since 2020: https://feedback.bistudio.com/T151046

Am I missing something or have to give up on it?",,
