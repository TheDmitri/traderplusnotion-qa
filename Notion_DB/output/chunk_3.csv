148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 7:11 PM,@Arkensor how do you properly garbage collect?,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 7:12 PM,Delete ain't working right for array members I think,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/18/2018 7:12 PM,Remove all references to something,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/18/2018 7:12 PM,GC is done implicitly not expliciticly,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 7:12 PM,I remove all reference and the destructor still isn't called,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/18/2018 7:13 PM,Then there is still a reference,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 7:13 PM,Hm,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 7:13 PM,I'll check,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 7:59 PM,anyone know if enscript supports class encapsulation,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 7:59 PM,I'm trying to figure out how to implement namespaces,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 8:08 PM,U don't,,
148054598479773696,misteroutoftime,10/18/2018 8:08 PM,Nothing but script modules seperate code,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:15 PM,Yeah I figured that,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:16 PM,I'm not sure how script modules work though,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:18 PM,are they isolated from each other?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:18 PM,do they prevent class naming conflicts?,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:18 PM,I'm assuming so,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:20 PM,hmm no you can access the classes of another file i think even addon,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:20 PM,so you still get name conflicts,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:21 PM,yeah,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:21 PM,that's actually retarded,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:21 PM,this prevents that you need to do inclusion of something like header files in c,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:21 PM,fair enough,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:22 PM,so basicially a gamescript module tells the engibe to autoinclude headers?,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:22 PM,yeah seems so,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:22 PM,ok,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,that clears some things up,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,Does enscript  support inner classes?,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,yeah,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,if you mean classes in classes,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,alright sweet,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:23 PM,yeah,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:24 PM,time to implement pseudo namespaces lol,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:24 PM,well at least i thought i saw this somewhere,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/18/2018 8:24 PM,bug can't find it atm,,
107689319396831232,jezithyr,10/18/2018 8:24 PM,I'll test it,,

456226577798135808,Deleted User,10/24/2018 1:11 PM,Hey how does one spawn items in game?,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,10/24/2018 1:13 PM,"```c
/**
\brief Creates object of certain type
@param type of objects to create
@param pos position where to create object
@param create_local if True, object is not spawned on clients only on server
@param init_ai if creating object is LightAI class, by this param is initialised AI or not
\return new Object
*/

proto native Object CreateObject( string type, vector pos, bool create_local = false, bool init_ai = false, bool create_physics = true );
```

and you would use it like so

```c
GetGame().CreateObject( ""Apple"", ""0 0 0"" );
```",,
