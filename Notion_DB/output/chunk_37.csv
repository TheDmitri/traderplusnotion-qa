167370568893464576,0x346e3730,08/22/2019 5:44 PM,Badly designed if that's the actual case,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,08/22/2019 5:44 PM,Not at all. It was designed for the specific use case of the hive communication.,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,08/22/2019 5:44 PM,All they did is expose that curl functions they used already internally so we can use them,,

167370568893464576,0x346e3730,08/22/2019 5:45 PM,And it's not enough for some use cases that modding needs,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,08/22/2019 5:45 PM,Sure. Just letting you know there is no interest in that right now at all. Exposing the existing interface was already the max that was planned for now,,
428365376959807499,jbae#3434,08/22/2019 5:45 PM,"Honestly, all it needs is call backs, HTTP header support and all HTTP RESTful verbs",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,08/22/2019 5:46 PM,There is no technical requirement for any of that. It's just convince .. you can do it all with the current interface and middleware,,

I've been hiring several different modders to work on The Apocalypse of Enoch server, and even though we just went live last week, we have encountered a significant problem to our server growth. Bases are despawning. Our server set up is based on the book setting (We're sponsored by Shane Moore) so it is faction Federation vs ZOD with independants being freeman. faction warefare means elaborate bases, base raids, and squad on squad combat. 

Players will spend weeks creating eleborate bases to secure gear and to defend enemy raids, but we are losing players back to Miscreated because all the hard work they spend on a base dissappears. Our mod team is at a loss on how to fix this despawn issue.

Our server runs on a dedicated line with a dedicated tower. No performance issues. Just looking for someone to solve the base decay issue. I'll pay, like I do our normal mod team, for anyone that can solve my problem.

Thanks a ton!",,
200688949448933386,chambersenator,08/25/2019 5:50 AM,"@Agent 32 ZOD. Are entire bases being wiped, or is it just sections here and there? Are the  disappearing base parts older than 45 days, and they didn't interact with them to reset the timers? Do the players know about the timers for basebuilding and how to reset them? Have you tried increased the lifetime value of fences and watchtowers in your types.xml file to 90 days? Are the log files showing any entries about restoring data from a backup due to a corruption in the db file?

Knowing the answers to those would help narrow the possible causes down significantly.",,

need something more dynamic but not sure whether or not there is any

and another question

if you override a function, do you need to keep the argement names the same? those are just variables, can you rename them?

example

```cpp
override void CommandHandler(float pDt, int pCurrentCommandID, bool pCurrentCommandFinished)    
to
override void CommandHandler(float deltaTime, int currentCommandID, bool currentCommandFinished)    ```",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/26/2019 8:09 PM,"well you can setup a config on your own to read from disk, but if you override a function, you can not rename the argument names",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/26/2019 8:09 PM,because if you call `super` the original class won't take the renamed variables,,
