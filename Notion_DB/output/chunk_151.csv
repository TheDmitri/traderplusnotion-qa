1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,04/19/2023 8:06 PM,What would you suggest is the maximum size to use before it gets wonky?,,
277431897133678593,tuimz,04/19/2023 9:03 PM,If you use community offline tools and packed pbo to test your mods locally can you somewhere see the Print() statements?,,

142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:21 PM,Best way I can think of doing this is to add all of the fences and their vectors into a map array and then use Distance function between the objects,,
142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:22 PM,By fences do you mean placed fences or static map fences?,,
179307958046294016,koizumisakiko,04/19/2023 9:24 PM,Placed fences,,

142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:25 PM,Well you have to check for every fence,,
142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:26 PM,"Although since it's already placed, you might be able to just check it instead of doing a map array",,
142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:27 PM,Get the class name of the object and once you place down get it's vector and then check if any other object is in range that has the same class from whatever is storing the object in the world that got placed,,
142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:28 PM,"If you have territory poles, you can probably look into how that's done as I believe you can only build another one within certain distance of an already placed one",,
142020960323764224,argy.,04/19/2023 9:31 PM,"Yes script log, are you running it on your pc from workbench?",,

Hey guys. 
I hope someone can help me.

I have a gun with 2 magazine slots.
Green marked is normal magazine slot, loading bullet.
Red one is supposed to be a ""spare magazine slot"" taking normal magazines of that gun.

I created a new slot for that  ""spare magazine"", assigned it to the magazine and the gun.

Issue now is, if I have a magazine loaded and drag a magazine on the spare magazine slot, it does reload (switch) magazines instead of attaching it.

I have literally no idea where to start forcing the magazine to go into that new slot, if a magazine is loaded.
Happy about help.```",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1099077762419003533/20230421214814_1.jpg,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,04/24/2023 12:52 AM,trying to figure out whats wrong,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/24/2023 12:52 AM,"if you're creating objects and handling any data related to the server, check IsServer before doing all your stuff, because EEKilled is called on both server and client",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/24/2023 12:56 AM,"for things wrong:
- you do a lot of nesting
- you're using for loops, when with this context a foreach loop is efficient
- when you are using for loops, you're excessively calling `array.Get()` which you're reaccessing the array each time you do this (you're greatly increasing execution time of script, slowing down everything when a player is killed)
- you don't do any null checking
- this entire function can be broken up into multiple functions for readability",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/24/2023 12:58 AM,same goes for what you just showed in EEKilled,,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,04/24/2023 1:01 AM,"wrote it a couple years ago, its always used for loops and its never popped anything in a crash or script log, so i've left it alone. the only issue its really having is the only showing the loot after client relogs.  i'll look at the difference between for and foreach and convert those, but i dont think thats whats causing the loot/relog issue.",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/24/2023 1:01 AM,"another thing to note too, is that you're using a static function with static class members for your spawner function, which probably results in a lot of extremely difficult debugging in this context",,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,04/24/2023 1:02 AM,when it did it just a void it errored when i tried to call it i believe,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,04/24/2023 1:03 AM,don't store the variable as a class member if you're going continue to do it this way,,

185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 2:56 PM,some people like vscode some people like workbench,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 2:57 PM,yes but its limited,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 2:57 PM,look up file patching,,
244042130329305088,nzsnapshot,04/25/2023 2:58 PM,I'm assuming you can like hotreload client side stuff,,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,04/25/2023 3:00 PM,i'll have to find a link for it and check it out,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 3:03 PM,Before you do just no its not a vscode replacement. VSCode is a text editor whereas jetbrains (IntelliJ each language has its own set of languages it supports) is an IDE. While there are plugins for 90% of the languages vscode plugins you have to keep in mind that most plugins add things from languages to project types sdks and even compilers,,

185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 3:08 PM,InteliJ is more for java/kotlin out of the box Rider is for C#,,
185697101735264257,flipperplz,04/25/2023 3:09 PM,Rider is the BEST for backend c# development,,

You need to use the `CreateAttachment` instead of `CreateInInventory`

561680015578759196,wrdg,04/27/2023 10:13 PM,i can't remember if `animHitDir` is already inverted,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/27/2023 10:13 PM,so i inverted it,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/27/2023 10:14 PM,you'd want to check ammo type or source type to determine if knock back should be applied,,

I am thinking about, how exactly i can implement - That troll is zombie based, so maybe add knockback to some of zombie attack animation?

292453878652469250,snacksbr,04/27/2023 10:18 PM,hand is a type of ammo i think,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/27/2023 10:19 PM,you'd want to handle that in the command handler of the actual creature,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,04/27/2023 10:19 PM,not on player,,

and 2) Script to weapon? Like only hit by this weapon will cause that knockback",,
