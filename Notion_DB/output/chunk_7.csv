106435033203482624,kerkkoh,11/08/2018 10:15 PM,I'm fairly certain they will fix this tomorrow. Because I think the crafting system is broken because of the filesystem operations being broken. I could be wrong though.,,

295660175237447691,sentepu,11/08/2018 10:18 PM,good thing easier to create recipes,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:20 PM,and it is working,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:25 PM,cuz you are not editing the json from the server in runtime,,

295660175237447691,sentepu,11/08/2018 10:27 PM,maps are key associated values arrays,,

295660175237447691,sentepu,11/08/2018 10:28 PM,because you trust a sequence to know which data represent what ?,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:30 PM,but for example in map,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:32 PM,the script will have no idea who the one you are trying to interact with,,
295660175237447691,sentepu,11/08/2018 10:32 PM,well basing your logic on a 'my key 0 is name and my key 36 is position' i think thats just bad logic,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:33 PM,no that's dumb i didn't say that,,
295660175237447691,sentepu,11/08/2018 10:33 PM,because you identify player by steamID and not name,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 10:33 PM,yeah thats what i wanted to say right now,,

474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/08/2018 11:49 PM,ah right,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:50 PM,the difference between player and identity is:,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:50 PM,"Identity, is your client, like your game itself",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:50 PM,and the listener that connects to the server,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:50 PM,"the player, is the PlayerBase element, that the server spawns for you, the character you control",,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:51 PM,that's why you use for example GetGame().GetIdentity().GetPlainId() to get the steam id,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:51 PM,because the ID is stored inside the client not the player,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:51 PM,"and use GetGame().GetInventory() to get the inventory, because the inventory is part of the PlayerBase",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/08/2018 11:52 PM,"and GetIdentity is server side only, you can't get Identities on client side of other players",,

135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 1:13 AM,"Question, when we ""mod"" a class; does our custom modded class is added to default file, or that override evrything in the class ? Cause I got this, and can't figure out...",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/510245520598499357/unknown.png,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:24 AM,It's similar to extending it,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:24 AM,You don't need to redefine anything,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:24 AM,But you can override methods,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:24 AM,(just make sure to call the super method if needed),,
135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 1:26 AM,"Ooooh, you saved me a lot of time, and that really good for what I need to do üòÑ",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:28 AM,"To clarify, if you override a method, calling super.Method() will call the method in the *unmodded* class",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:30 AM,an easier explanation,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:30 AM,"lets say, you want to mod MissionServer",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:30 AM,it has a lot of functions already defined,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:30 AM,"and there is a function, you want to change, for example, OnClientNew",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:30 AM,you created your modded class: modded class MissionServer,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:31 AM,and you create a function called void OnClientNew(),,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:31 AM,"so when the script is being compiled, in MissionServer it will replace the built in function with yours",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:31 AM,and keep all the others,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:31 AM,"so if you wan't to modify the OnClientNew, you just copypaste the whole function and edit it",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:32 AM,its like replacing the function with yours thats inside your modded class,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:33 AM,"in this case override is not needed, because you are modding the function, not extending / deriving it",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:34 AM,"You don't *have* to ""replace"" the function though. e.g. for something like PlayerBase.EEKilled() where you want to be notified about a player's death, but you don't care about what the PlayerBase class itself does with that information",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:34 AM,yeah i meant in cases where you wan't to rewrite / modify a specific function,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:37 AM,Hm. Will omitting override cause problems if it's a function further up the class hierarchy?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:38 AM,"well, override does not work in every case",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:38 AM,before actually using modded class i was trying to go by extend and derive,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:38 AM,but if you tried to override an event function like OnKeyPress or OnRPC,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:38 AM,"e.g. if the game calls something on say EntityAI, that PlayerBase overrides, will the function in your modded class get called of the call is made on EntityAI rather than PlayerBase?",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:38 AM,it did not work,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,"well, the modded class is the same as the PlayerBase",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,"moddedclass just contains functions, that replaces the ones in playerbase",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,"so if something calls that specific function you replaced, yes it will call the modded van",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,Oh I suppose if you were replacing a function that already was an override you'd use override anyway,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,"Yeah, modding replaces the base function",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:39 AM,"so if you override that, you override the modded function",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 1:41 AM,"Thank's a lot for those explanations, that will help a lot, not only me I guess üòÉ",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:42 AM,I'd think the only methods you wouldn't be able to override are those implemented in native code..,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:44 AM,"There are some functions, like mentioned above the Weather cant be modded",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:44 AM,Object either,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:44 AM,Well Object is native,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:45 AM,Oh I guess it isn't,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:45 AM,"but most of the functions that you cant mod, are not required to be modded , there are other options to reach what you want to do",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:45 AM,I know there is a mix and a match,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:46 AM,Object is a core type of script,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:46 AM,that fathers for example EntityAI,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:46 AM,It also has a private constructor,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:46 AM,I've had errors about that before,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:47 AM,"Weather is  a native class tho, only prototypes are defined in script",,
