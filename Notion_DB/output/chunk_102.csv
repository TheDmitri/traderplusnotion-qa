456226577798135808,Deleted User,09/30/2021 10:27 AM,It checks for protection values on each of these inventory slots for the protection level. If you would want only the mask slot for example the simplest solution is to only return that slot from the according method in bleedingmanagerserver,,

Most of your time scripting is going to be ‚Äúreverse engineering‚Äù the scripts, mainly finding what you want to mod, the systems connected and sample syntax and logic within the vanilla scripts. A good majority here use Mikero‚Äôs tools, DayZ2P is a good start to get things unpacked, you‚Äôd want to download the DayZ tools first and setup a P: drive to dedicate your projects and vanilla source to.",,
223598011735867392,.expunged,10/12/2021 10:35 PM,Yeah SQF is nowhere near Enforce and I'm mostly familiar with other OOP language. To find out methods and whatnot I'll have to go into the game's own scripts or others'? I've been spoiled with the Arma Community Wiki lol,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/12/2021 10:39 PM,"Correct, for BI to create a wiki like how it is with SQF would take an immense amount of time as they'd have to create their own documentation parser and go back over everything. There's not really a decent entry point to get started. I'd suggest getting a code editor that can do mass searches, like VS Code or Sublime (Ctrl + Shift + F), which will search in an entire directory and sub directories for the text you're wanting to find. DayZ isn't full Enfusion either, and you'll find some similarities with arma for the config side of things (CfgVehicles, Units, etc).",,

float NegativeLerp = LerpMod(time, min, max, mod) - (time * 2);

173448803578281984,inkihh,10/18/2021 10:48 PM,"If a closable container, like a barrel, is closed, do the contained items still go into player's network bubbles?",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/18/2021 10:48 PM,yes,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/18/2021 10:49 PM,"if an item is in an inventory of an item within your network bubble, it's networked to you",,
173448803578281984,inkihh,10/18/2021 10:55 PM,so the rumour that closable containers create less server stress than always-open ones is bullshit indeed,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,10/18/2021 10:56 PM,Correct.,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,10/18/2021 10:57 PM,I think stashes are the only way to limit load as it only needs to network the stash and not it‚Äôs contents yet.,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/18/2021 11:04 PM,"stashes aren't an exception either, their network bubble is smaller than normal items though",,

512136744150237209,xdonutx,10/18/2021 11:34 PM,MA is outdated.,,
512136744150237209,xdonutx,10/18/2021 11:34 PM,And i just want that feature but updated for 1.14,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,10/18/2021 11:36 PM,Probably not too difficult.,,
512136744150237209,xdonutx,10/18/2021 11:43 PM,Pretty interested in someone making it for me.,,
512136744150237209,xdonutx,10/18/2021 11:43 PM,Would pay tho. Depending on the price. Hopefully not too expensive.,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,10/18/2021 11:47 PM,It‚Äôs always best to create a UI that doesn‚Äôt feel like a nuisance if it‚Äôs for something that minuscule,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,10/19/2021 12:10 AM,Could you use the notification system UI?,,
512136744150237209,xdonutx,10/19/2021 12:56 AM,Well. Possible to have it the same way MA attention does it? Just some red text that shows on the bottom left of the screen for 10-20 seconds?,,
