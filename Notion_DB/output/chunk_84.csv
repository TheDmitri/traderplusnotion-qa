in 1.11 it looks like this ```c
float divided = (float) ((60 * 5) + Math.RandomInt(0, 60 * 1)) / fertility;
m_FullMaturityTime = divided;```which is normal so far. 60 seconds times 5 means 5 minutes plus up to one minute divided by the fertility.
However in 1.12 it looks like this```c
m_FullMaturityTime += Math.RandomInt(-60,180);
float divided = /*(float) ((60 * 5) + Math.RandomInt(0, 60 * 1)) / fertility;*/ m_FullMaturityTime;```So... this now has a ``+=`` which means it just adds on top of an already esisting ``m_FullMaturityTime``? and the previous calculation is commented out... i can seam to find where the base value for ``m_FullMaturityTime`` is defined... does someone already know or can help me out there?",,
