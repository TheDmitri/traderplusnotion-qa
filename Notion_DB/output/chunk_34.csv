219655169644822538,unfortunate_duck,07/07/2019 10:03 PM,"What I'm mostly confused about is... I have an object I'd like to be place-able by the player, like fences or anything else that uses advanced placement. Do I need to script my own placement or is there something I can setup in my config that will give it those abilities... I understand the hologram might have something to do with it, but when I look at other peoples configs for similar objects I find they all are set up a bit different. Sorry if this is a confusing question, I'm confused.",,

207328818203983872,notabanana,07/07/2019 10:16 PM,"So heres how people learn: They have a question, like yours (How do I make my item placeable). Step one,  set up p drive, and grab some sort of software that has find in files. Step two, look at how vanilla items do it, so search something like maybe `class barrel` across all .c files to find the script class for the barrel",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,07/07/2019 10:16 PM,You'll find `P:\scripts\4_world\entities\itembase\barrel_colorbase.c`,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,07/07/2019 10:17 PM,"Then skim around through that and eventually you'll come across something like this: ```    override void SetActions()

107560637399306240,cooltrain,07/07/2019 11:08 PM,Chance is low but I might as well ask. Does anyone know where the server handles its connections for the first time? The client version is in dayzgame.c but I can't seem to find where the server recives it.,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,07/07/2019 11:09 PM,I.e I expect the same place the server would verify the password that was sent (though I can't find that either so I don't think its exposed),,

160185978131185664,kh4zy,07/08/2019 12:42 AM,Can anyone give me a hint where to look for the script for fire / firebarrels in general? I want to tweak some audio volume,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,07/08/2019 12:43 AM,You just want to config the volume ? :think360:,,

160185978131185664,kh4zy,07/08/2019 12:48 AM,Okay thanks üòÉ Ill try to take a look. Should ive be looking under sound folder?,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,07/08/2019 12:49 AM,I'm not sure actually :think360:,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,07/08/2019 12:49 AM,Should be in structures or something more specific,,
160185978131185664,kh4zy,07/08/2019 12:50 AM,"Well, I was thinking maybe it was possible to make a script, and modify the volume via a script, rather than changing the source file? Well, its my first time making an actual script but wouldnt that be possible?",,

211779129924780032,hlynge,07/15/2019 7:00 PM,"@Cooltrain - this mod used the Lockpick to make it possible to lock houses and give them a code. It require a masterLock Pick to enable a house to be locked and then it has functionality to prevent that brute force is used. if the code is entered in correct 3 times there is a 15 minute cooldown. Mod features:
1. Can enable or disable doors for using code locking.
2. Can change codes.
3. Can set guest code (guest code can only open door, so user who has it cn't change password).
4. Doors locked with code or without it will remain locked / closed after server restart. (Fixed persistence issue with mod here).
5. You can unlock any code locked door with ""LockPickMaster"" item at any time.
6. Door lockout. After 5 failed attempts to unlock door it will be locked for 15 minutes and play alert sound.
7. Sounds. Sounds when interacting with door via the mod.

While doing it I wonder how I could have different sets of gear since it seems to be setup for a single set and random % within that set. First issue. Second issue is how to spawn with gear in the box. The box is showing up, but empty. I tried using event types Item and Vehicle, but no luck.

You can alternatively use an onupdate function, or the ways show cased in this file, but yeah",,

For example:
int DefineData1 = DataLoadedValue.Get(id);

DataLoadedValue.Insert(id, Data1);
int DefineData1 = DataLoadedValue.Get(id);

Spawning it in his hands results in a non accessible item (not reload able in script and so on) which is not even showing in his loot.
Spawning it on his back makes the weapon show up in his loot, but still does not let me put it into his hands. I am currently using the same method that is called when dropped into the hand area when in inventory: PredictiveTakeEntityToHands( item_base );  <- this is being called from a modded PlayerBase class
