Is there a different way or more simple way im missing? I think from iv probably got {} brackets enclosing my if statement which i shouldnt have (directly below the B in bool car_in_zone) but i have tried removing those and made no difference so readded them for now

 If not clear im trying to take an xyz coordinate and set a radius to check for a car and then run the setthrust if its in the radius.
also yes i am playing around with the set thrust that tree posted the other day and i said was silly ü§£.

This is going to be configurable from a json (speed, coordinates, radius, notification, message ect) but i was having so much trouble i removed all that and just set coordinates to rule all that out

Be gentle...

240120744325939200,olmotje,11/19/2022 6:01 PM,"so my brother is figured out howto make my armband non removeable and it works 
inside Armband_ColorBase i do 
```modded class Armband_ColorBase    // modded keyword for modding an existing class
{
      override bool CanDetachAttachment( EntityAI parent )
  {
  PlayerBase player;
  Class.CastTo(player, GetHierarchyRootPlayer());
  return false; // (player && !player.IsAlive());
  }
}```

would i be able to remove the wetness in this file to by doing this ? 
``` modded class Armband_ColorBase    // modded keyword for modding an existing class
{
      override bool CanDetachAttachment( EntityAI parent )
  {

  return false; // (player && !player.IsAlive());

  override bool CanHaveWetness()

However from the tests I have conducted, EEDelete does my print when the server starts up it wipes the cars I spawned in before the shutdown. So it seems when you start the server if it plans to wipe vehicles or whatever from low lifetimes or such even when a player is still next to the car during shutdown. It will delete said entity upon the next server startup not shutdown. Atleast that's how it's logged. These 3 vehicles were spawned in and I shut the server down no logs. Started the server up they were wiped and logged.

It creates several classes that include a modded missiongameplay class - `UIMissionGameplay`. DaOne suggested making it an option to run the UI builder directly from workbench.

trying to manually initialize AI on created entity, something like `init_ai` from `CreateObject( .... bool init_ai = false ... );` but i want another param `bool EnableAI = false` (or another alternative if possible) for later use when reading from config.
I found only this in vanilla for manual init ai...
```
    /*!
    AIAgent initialization.
    Manual ai initialization for creatures created with CreateObject(... init_ai = false...).
    */
    proto native void InitAIAgent(AIGroup group);
```
but I can't find a single example of how to use it, does anyone have an example please? Or another alternative?

I want to create a method where it will be possible to choose whether the entity:
1.) will be dead or not - this works for me as I wanted,
2.) and also for the entity to be
     a.) static with animations but standing in place - I got this working too
     b.) or the second option for it to move freely in the place where it spawned - I don't know how to do this yet",,

so basicly if i would to invoke a
 ReplaceItemWithNewLambda

this would make item 1 to be replaced by item 2 

so in my case its an armband i want to replace i can do this inside armband_colorbase wich i mod ? 
and then as soon as i add a trigger were if 1 armband gets placed inside a player inventory it would be able to replace this item automagicly

is this the correct way to interpertate this ?",,

what can i do to make sure that it hides in both scenarios ie, attaching to a car that has the mirrors or attaching the mirrors to a car with the doors already attached? iv been trying to do it for a while an im getting nowhere. i also need to figure out how to make it save the stat its in i guess so that it makes sure it keeps the visual state (although i guess if the script is working and it knows what is attached and when to show/hide at all times then it wont be necessary to save the state.)

The mirrors i want to hide are part of the door proxy so that slot is on the car,  the fender mirrors are their own slot on the car. For reference iv added a picture circled in green is the ones i want to hide when the one circled in yellow are attached, just incase it was confusing at all with all the mirror talk. 

I did think about making it so the door mirrors were part of the car for ease of hiding them and just have them only show qnd move with the doors if the doors where fitted and the fender mirrors wernt but then the doors when detached wouldnt have mirrors. 
although i suppose i could have mirrors on the doors show when the doors are detached and hide when attached to the car and then show the doormirrors that are part of the car but hide the door mirrors that are part of the car if the fender mirrors where attached but that sounds like its getting far too compicated ü§£",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1045558813480190072/240z_Rusty_with_Arches.jpg,

`autoptr TStringArray LogSlots = { ""Material_L1_WoodenLogs"", ""Material_L2_WoodenLogs"", ""Material_L3_WoodenLogs"", ""Material_FPole_WoodenLog2"" };`

And an int to remember the amount of wooden Logs.

`int m_LogsStored = 0;`

It's `CountLogs()` that counts the wooden logs.",,
