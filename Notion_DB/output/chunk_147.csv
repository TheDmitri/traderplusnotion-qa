414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,03/22/2023 8:33 PM,or how can i tell whether its actually being loaded server and client. and not just client,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,03/22/2023 8:33 PM,It's nothing to do with playerbase but how the mod is loaded. As normal mod or serversided mod,,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,03/22/2023 8:34 PM,"then yes, this is loaded on both client and server. and this is the ONLY netsync i do. just these 2 variables",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,03/22/2023 8:35 PM,Then your netsynch vars are mostly not the issue. Could he an issue in another mod though. One mod fucking it up is enough,,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,03/22/2023 8:35 PM,loading ONLY this mod. it has to be coming from here.,,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,03/22/2023 8:40 PM,Doubt it changes anything but move the actual registration of the net sync vars right below your super.Init call. You use the variables before they are registered,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/22/2023 8:45 PM,I personally prefer to have netsync variables set in their declaration instead of setting them after registering,,

I have a question if someone can help me i would really appreciate it.

I  want to make a raid system on my vanilla server like so:
- wooden or metal fences takes damage only from grenades, not guns
- wooden fence takes 5 grenades to get destroyed
- metal fence takes 10 grenades
- once a fence is destroyed, the frame is prestine, and takes 350 bullet of akm or something similar.

641390256897261598,sclowtonez,03/28/2023 5:41 PM,I could but I'm on my phone at work so this is kind of difficult if I was on my computer and had script in front of me it would be so much easier,,

250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 5:53 PM,yeah it seemed weird to me too,,
535230913739751425,nikerage,03/28/2023 5:55 PM,"Wardog helped me with that, if the inv is hidden on create and loot is spawned inside there you can see it after unlocking but can’t get it out",,

250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 5:56 PM,i feel cheated,,
641390256897261598,sclowtonez,03/28/2023 5:57 PM,Maybe because it's skipping that second if statement,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 5:57 PM,that wouldnt stop it from adding the apple though would it?,,
641390256897261598,sclowtonez,03/28/2023 5:58 PM,Well if it's trying to register if locked in the first one in line gets read before the second one then yeah it will never be seen,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 5:58 PM,hmmmm...,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2023 11:19 PM,you pass an index to change a specific indexed part of your object,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:19 PM,hmmm interesting,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:19 PM,How would I get the index of this?,,

250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:19 PM,its 3 different objects currently,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2023 11:19 PM,"either by name, or if you already know it",,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:20 PM,oh cool,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:20 PM,"So I need to add it to hiddenselections no matter what, then I can just..trigger it with a script?",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2023 11:20 PM,the hiddenselections array in your config will represent the index,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2023 11:21 PM,arrays start at zero in enforce,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:21 PM,"Ohhh I think I have an idea now, thanks",,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,03/28/2023 11:21 PM,doesn't work that way it depends on how the maker did the uvmap from what it see its all in one paa,,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,03/28/2023 11:21 PM,it looks like just changing the paa is enough in this case,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:21 PM,Yeah im modifying the model a bit,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:22 PM,ive already changed up UVs a bit,,
641390256897261598,sclowtonez,03/28/2023 11:22 PM,swap between both paa's,,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,03/28/2023 11:22 PM,heres the question do you want the lock to change permantly or by script you didnt specify that,,

1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,03/28/2023 11:23 PM,does the model do this by default or do you want to implement this?,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2023 11:24 PM,`player` in this instance will be the player doing the action,,
1062405350403358731,salvaenidayz,03/28/2023 11:24 PM,and have the lock be its own component/hidden selection,,
250426565114986509,squallz,03/28/2023 11:24 PM,yeah im gonna split it into its own object,,
