239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 3:59 PM,ü§î you must be doing something wrong. The memory point is supposed to be the best way to accomplish what you are doing,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:00 PM,"okay, add the light source memory point onto the parent object instead",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:00 PM,and have it switch when attached,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:00 PM,from child to parent memory,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:01 PM,(the parent),,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:02 PM,"well it would be simple, you are probably overcomplicating it. There should be an event you can override when something is attached onto an object",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:02 PM,and have your logic in there to switch mem point,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:03 PM,there has to be a solution in there,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:04 PM,because chemlights follow the backpack,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:04 PM,pretty sure they just use the same mem point. Maybe they run some sort of update on attached,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:04 PM,"yeah, hoping so",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:06 PM,you are doing something similar to this?,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/585831779420864514/unknown.png,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:06 PM,correct,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:07 PM,"```c

            m_Light = SafeLockLight.Cast(ScriptedLightBase.CreateLight(SafeLockLight, ""0.043 0 0.023"", 0)); // Position is zero because light is attached on parent immediately.

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:07 PM,and SafeLockLight has all the necessary stuff as a `PointLightBase`,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:08 PM,okay i would suggest to try updating the lightsource position after being attached onto parent,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:09 PM,That is not required. Instead move the light source further in front of the object,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:09 PM,And see if it properly displays there when not obstructed by any of the lods,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:09 PM,oh i thought the light did not show up at all,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:10 PM,in that case yea Mr.HypeTrain is right :PepeLaugh:,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:10 PM,"the light is there, but it's not moving when the door closes",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:11 PM,Oh and it wont move,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:11 PM,Only when you teleport the safe as as a whole object,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:11 PM,the AttachOnMemoryPoint is using AddChild,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:11 PM,which only takes the object as whole into account.,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:12 PM,What you need to do is to update the the light position with the memory position in a little timer while opening,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:12 PM,or only one time when you opened it,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,"fun, a 0.67 second timer haha",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,The AttachOnMemoryPoint is only using the mem point to calculate the local offset once,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,its not an active follower,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,is the lightsource attached to another item which is attached to the safe?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,yeah,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,"the light is on the lock mech, the lock mech is a proxy attachment to the safe",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:13 PM,It only follows the parent orientation and position,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,"in that case, update the position when close/open",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,:HMM:,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,Yeah thats what I just said Mark,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,"yeah, I'll have to do that",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,:feelsGunMan:,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,oh? :omegaROLL:,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,I wanted it too look a bit smoother,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,i said that as well,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,but that'll have to do for now I guess,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,Well you can make it look smooth,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:14 PM,by just doing a timer on 0.01,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:15 PM,and let it run until its fully closed or opened,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:15 PM,and that refreshes the m_Light position,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:15 PM,"that's a good idea, I can do that",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:15 PM,"its just m_Light.SetPosition( GetMemoryPointPos "" light"" )",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:15 PM,if the memory point is moving with the door that should work fine,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:16 PM,"which is accessible by SafeLock.m_Light, so that'll work from the parent easily enough for triggering",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,06/05/2019 4:16 PM,if its also staying in place you need to do math to setpos it along a virtual curve,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/05/2019 4:16 PM,that makes sense,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:51 PM,So I could place it in mission gameplay?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:52 PM,You cannot make new GUI easily especially with new graphics on server side only,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:52 PM,So couldnt I place it into a client side only script,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:53 PM,It's not arma where the UI is sent by the server,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:53 PM,There is a few mods on the wrkshop I think that use icons and images,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:53 PM,It would probably require a sync of some nature and client + server code,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:54 PM,I thought itd just be a matter of setting up the widget,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:54 PM,and using it,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:54 PM,I use a text widget and it works fine,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:55 PM,How about adding it to IngameHUd ?,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:55 PM,The client still would require any new images you add,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:55 PM,The server does not send files to the client,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:55 PM,The radiation mod on the workshop uses images and it works but I dont know how he did it,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:56 PM,Radiation mod has client side code,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:56 PM,And UI,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:56 PM,How does he do it? Does he make a UI like you suggested earlier?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:57 PM,"Yes. Client side ui, then the value is handled and synced like other stats",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,06/13/2019 11:57 PM,So if I want to do that where do i begin?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:57 PM,And then the client adjusts the display based on the stats,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:59 PM,I would personally probably start with creating the scripted UI code and setting up a reference in mission client to instantiate it for thr client,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/13/2019 11:59 PM,MissionGameplay I mean,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/14/2019 8:53 PM,it means that you have a situation where you are not casting then checking the cast was successful before processing further logic,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/14/2019 8:54 PM,"ie:

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/17/2019 11:09 PM,"Okay so if you have an object like:
```c
Object myObject;```
And you want to be dealing with a Flashlight for example:

```c
Object object;
Flashlight flashlight;
if (Class.CastTo(flashlight, object))
    // do stuff
```",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/17/2019 11:10 PM,"Or 

```c
Object object;
Flashlight flashlight = Flashlight.Cast(object);

if (flashlight)
    // do stuff
```",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/17/2019 11:12 PM,Select the whole tent in the p3d in your highest res lod,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/17/2019 11:12 PM,Create a new selection called placing,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,06/17/2019 11:12 PM,And make sure to redefine so it updates properly,,
