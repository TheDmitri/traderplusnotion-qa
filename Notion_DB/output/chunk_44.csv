Pre 1.06 we had a mod setup for skinning animals to give less meat and worked great, tried updating this by transfering all the new 1.06 config.bin files for each animal and editing each back to the skinning values we had.

In game still default skinning counts.

Tried adding the main config in which for some reason when i skin a cow I get my count of 2 meat i set but only once or twice then it changes to 5 or 7.

All other animals still just default.  really odd...

If anyone can help me out I would be greatly appreciative!",,

If you can wrap your head around object oriented programming, Enforce shouldn't be hard to pick up. Most of the documentation you're going to be reading is from unpacked game files, and not everything is documented, so you'll have to interpret the logic or just ask questions; most of us here know a good majority of the ins and outs for the scripting structure behind DayZ.",,

you can modify the flare in config like this but i'd recommend just make a child class of the flare with the desired values so you don't affect the other player's flare's

I tried some RCON-Tools. but none of them provided such a function. 

The question ""why would you"" doesn't matter all too much in this context, but for good feels: Since I want to only edit ServerSide (No Client DLs), I had to write some basic Admin-Tools on my own. The problem is, that Targeting a Player would need the players to not have any spaces in their names. Sadly the Default Counting to Players goes with a leading space ""Survivor[SPACE](NUMBER)""

348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 12:53 AM,Im adding custom **cfgspawnabletypes.xml** (of creepy zombies mod) at the end of vanilla cfgspawnabletypes.xml,,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 12:53 AM,but the file hasn't a clear end,,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 12:54 AM,im not sure where to put it,,
164872154154795008,zelik,12/14/2019 3:01 AM,Is there a way to return a map keys value without looping through all the keys?,,
200688949448933386,chambersenator,12/14/2019 3:13 AM,"@Giaxpard at the very bottom of that xml should be a `</spawnabletypes>` that closes the group. Make a couple empty lines directly above that, and paste in your custom types there. If one isn't there, there should be.",,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 3:14 AM,Thank you @Chambersenator  !,,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 4:00 AM,does someone have a script to put infected in Topolin (Livonia) i raise all value but still remain with very few zombies,,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 4:08 AM,"""edit"": all citys and village are almost empty, talking about zombies (livonia)",,
200688949448933386,chambersenator,12/14/2019 5:22 AM,"@Giaxpard It's possible there's a missing ""pointy bracket"" ""<"" or "">"" somewhere in your AI-spawing related XML files. So it's loading in the stuff it can, but everything after that missing bracket is seen as one long confusing part, and it skips over it. They can be a pain to track down. Try using a vanilla XMLs to isolate the problem file, then put your custom stuff back in section by section and test it. I think notepad++ has a way to track it down faster, but after this happening once I became very careful with my copy/pastes",,üôÇ (1)
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,12/14/2019 5:42 AM,has anyone else noticed that bears don't seem to interact with other AI like wolves/infected do?,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,12/14/2019 5:44 AM,"wolves also don't seem to be bothered at all by their presence, nor do infected",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/14/2019 5:53 AM,It was stated that bears will not agro on other entities,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,12/14/2019 5:53 AM,not very realistic,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,12/14/2019 5:53 AM,and pretty lazy considering the functionality already exists,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,12/14/2019 5:54 AM,for cross AI interaction,,
348896554616225792,giaxpard,12/14/2019 7:38 AM,"@Chambersenator thank you mate. I saw that in territories, static zombie was 0 and dinamic very low",,

235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 9:49 AM,Do we have basic synchronization for thread in Enforce ?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 9:57 AM,There are no threads in Enforce per say,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 9:57 AM,:peepoShrug:,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:00 AM,.Call creating new thread independent from main thread,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:01 AM,So it's thread inside the language,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:01 AM,Its not really tough,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:01 AM,Even if it's not physically threaded on the machine,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:01 AM,It all executes sequentially in games main thread,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:02 AM,So synchronization primitives are pointless,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:03 AM,"So if it is the case, maybe a way to know if it's main thread from Enforce executed before ""thread"" created",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:03 AM,Set a bool?,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:03 AM,incremented counter?,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:04 AM,Maybe,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:04 AM,Will check that,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:04 AM,Its just a queue that executes sequentially,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:04 AM,At least it was last time i checked,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:05 AM,Wouldn't be surprised if ``Call`` would just be stubbed out for a direct function call,,

105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:05 AM,Noup it wont üòõ,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:06 AM,Also Enforce is pretty much fast enough to do anything,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:06 AM,"Yeah, it's fast until you reach the limit haha",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:06 AM,No such thing,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:07 AM,SVZ will have a big calculation for real voice occluding,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:07 AM,"And maybe, I will not reach the limit",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:08 AM,but will lower the main thread,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,12/14/2019 10:08 AM,"That's why, VOIP is threaded",,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:08 AM,Real time voice occluding can be done externally,,
105574798691680256,totallynotgrim,12/14/2019 10:08 AM,Also doing it in script is asking for trouble,,
