Yeah I figured your mod at least attempts to do universal mod compatibility while I just target mod-specific issues with exceptions there. It works for us perfectly so I'm content.

230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:09 AM,Can I access classes in 1_Mission in my world mod?,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:10 AM,I.e.: the `ScriptConsole`,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:12 AM,you can access lower script modules from higher script modules,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:12 AM,Ah thats what the numbers are for?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:12 AM,that's their compile order,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:13 AM,Ah okay,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:13 AM,So basically since World is 4 (and my mod is world mod) I cannot access the 5_Mission since my mod is 4_World?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:13 AM,"you can't access something in 5_Mission from 3_Game directly, because it's not compiled yet",,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:13 AM,Ah okay,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:14 AM,"there's boiler plating you can do, to access something from 5_Mission from 4_World",,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:14 AM,"But then if I wanted to do something in PlayerBase, I could do that in my own Mission module and with that access 5_Mission?",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:14 AM,yes,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:14 AM,Thanks,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:14 AM,"Interesting, how does this work?",,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:17 AM,Also is there any API documentation / reference available or is it just a matter of looking through the files from the game in P drive?,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:20 AM,"no, myself",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:20 AM,"better than doing something like this

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:21 AM,correct,,

230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:28 AM,Because PlayerBase does not exist in 5_Mission,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:29 AM,no you can't do it like that,,

230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:29 AM,Or can I do as you said and instead create a reference where it exists (an instance) and then use that in the place where PlayerBase exists?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/26/2020 3:29 AM,why do you need to mod PlayerBase in 5_Mission?,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:33 AM,Just wanted to create the ScriptConsole UI,,
230305350241353729,SimZor#5644,12/26/2020 3:33 AM,And that exists in 5_Mission,,
