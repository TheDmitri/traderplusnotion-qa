266878455809835008,misterj3012,06/25/2021 3:50 AM,"Hey guys, i try to create an infected detector and would need to get the angle 0-360 and yeah...
I get what i need, but it's from the wrong perspective i guess.
I'm using the pos x and z from the infected and use the GetPosition() on the detector and also use the x and z.

What i have and what i use is the following:

```static float FindDegree(float x, float z)
{
    float value = (float) ((Math.Atan2(x, z) / Math.PI) * 180);
    if (value < 0) value += 360;
    return value;
}```

Which seems to return the right values.
But i use iht like this:

```SetDirection(FindDegree(m_Infected.GetPosition()[0] - GetPosition()[0], m_Infected.GetPosition()[2] - GetPosition()[2]));```

Which i put into here:

```void SetDirection(float m_Angle)
{
    int m_Direction;
    if (m_Angle >= 337.5 && m_Angle <= 22.5)
        m_Direction = 1;
    if (m_Angle >= 22.5 && m_Angle <= 67.5)
        m_Direction = 2;
    if (m_Angle >= 67.5 && m_Angle <= 112.5)
        m_Direction = 3;
    if (m_Angle >= 112.5 && m_Angle <= 157.5)
        m_Direction = 4;
    if (m_Angle >= 157.5 && m_Angle <= 202.5)
        m_Direction = 5;
    if (m_Angle >= 202.5 && m_Angle <= 247.5)
        m_Direction = 6;
    if (m_Angle >= 247.5 && m_Angle <= 292.5)
        m_Direction = 7;
    if (m_Angle >= 292.5 && m_Angle <= 337.5)
        m_Direction = 8;
    Print(""Detector Direction: "" + m_Direction);
}```

But it's switching all the time between 1-3-6-3-1-2-3 so it's never a steady number which i could use for displaying the actual position of an infected...
Does anyone has an idea what i'm doing wrong?",,

Since what you are looking for is already automatically handled by ZombieBase.EEHitBy -> EvaluateDamageHitAnimation -> HandleDamageHit

I guess there's two options here, you could either just simply call StartCommand_Hit on the zombie to make it play the animation

Or you could call ProcessDirectDamage on it so that the damage properly goes through the damage system and EEHitBy gets called automatically and it's handled for you",,

I would make another separate mod for that and enable them as required add-ons through .CPP files and workshop dependencies so player can also install that if they want the extra functionality,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,06/30/2021 4:10 PM,It absolutely is inside code when used in code. And trouble is when mods are larger they sone always catch the defines and return false when they are true.,,

I've been working on this Menu screen for a few days now trying to fix this issue. I've just got to be missing something! Except, idk what üò¶ Perhaps you'd have any ideas or pointers for me?



So what I'm trying to figure out is: 
-Why the character_rotation_menu does not show the character in the main menu (it doesn't work in offline or on my server)
The switch character tabs don't seem to work out either :/

Second thing is - When I click on ""customize"" (the widget) it does indeed take me to the customize character menu that I made the layout for, except when using the mod on my server it does not show the character and the buttons in the menu dont work :/


So, here are the scripts in case you wanted to have a look:

So the main menu works perfectly when loading it as a mod on the server ONLY if you press ""PLAY"" and load directly into the main menu. HOWEVER when I just go through ""SETUP MODS AND DLCS AND JOIN"" and exit the server to get to the menu, I get the issue. That issue is when I click on the ""customize character"" or ""rename"" character that is supposed to take you to the charactercustomization menu nothing works. Itll take me to the layout fine, but there is no scene, no character loaded, and interacting with the buttons do nothing.

So Im thinking Ive done something wrong with my character customization script, but the layout is fine. that or Ive done something wrong with the MissionMainMenu script.

I would definitely appreciate any guidance or pointers .

Here are my two scripts:

the only thing ive changed in charactercreation.c is the layout path

the only thing ive changed in missionmainmenu.c is playing the music",,

459359748949671957,truenyxis,07/02/2021 1:56 PM,"Hey guys, still trying to figure out this issue. So the main menu works perfectly when loading it as a mod on the server ONLY if you press ""PLAY"" and load directly into the main menu. HOWEVER when I just go through ""SETUP MODS AND DLCS AND JOIN"" and exit the server to get to the menu, I get the issue. That issue is when I click on the ""customize character"" or ""rename"" character that is supposed to take you to the charactercustomization menu nothing works. Itll take me to the layout fine, but there is no scene, no character loaded, and interacting with the buttons do nothing.

So Im thinking Ive done something wrong with my character customization script, but the layout is fine. that or Ive done something wrong with the MissionMainMenu script.

I would definitely appreciate any guidance or pointers .

Here are my two scripts:

the only thing ive changed in charactercreation.c is the layout path

the only thing ive changed in missionmainmenu.c is playing the music",,
