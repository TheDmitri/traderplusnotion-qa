here's the lazy function, similar parameters from arma sqf, static global function, will conflict if multiple mods put it in their scripts, so would be useful if it was in some kind of lazy functions framework.

```cs

/// <param name=""orientation"">Optional - orientation</param>
/// <param name=""mem_point"">Optional - model memory point name for position, use 'local_pos' to offset</param>
static void AttachTo(notnull EntityAI child, notnull EntityAI parent, vector local_pos = ""0 0 0"", vector orientation = ""0 0 0"", string mem_point = """")

I don't know if an array or a switch is suitable for this, but I haven't managed a single option yet, I guess it's necessary to separate it somehow, otherwise it mixes with each other(?), but unfortunately I don't know how, could someone please help with an example? 

```fix

    case 0:
    itemEnt = player.GetInventory().CreateInInventory(""AthleticShoes_Blue""); itemBs = ItemBase.Cast(itemEnt);

    case 2:
    itemEnt = player.GetInventory().CreateInInventory(""AthleticShoes_Brown""); itemBs = ItemBase.Cast(itemEnt);

561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:11 AM,there isn't a way to send RPCs like this in CF unfortunately,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:11 AM,unless arkensor or jacob revamp it,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:13 AM,im having client trigger an RPC on the server that sends an RPC with the data back to client,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:13 AM,good times,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:13 AM,"typically you'd want to avoid a double send, unless there isn't way around it",,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:14 AM,"well, as far as I know theres no other way to have the client request server data than that",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:14 AM,unless something happens on the server that triggers it,,

265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:15 AM,and I dont want to do anything on login on player,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:15 AM,that shit crashes servers easy as anything,,

265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:16 AM,it just sends the data when the map is opened,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:17 AM,why not send the position each time the carepackage event is triggered by the server?,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:17 AM,I have to stay away or he just yeets the mod,,

265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:17 AM,and they wont have the data,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:17 AM,üôÇ,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:17 AM,not true at all but ok,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:18 AM,i've used it multiple times in the past and there's a plethora of mods that use it,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:18 AM,"maybe, but if I can avoid it I will",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:18 AM,but why not this though?,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:19 AM,"because, players login after its been called
and they wont have the data",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/15/2021 2:19 AM,sending an rpc upon the client opening the map each time is just unnecessary traffic,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/15/2021 2:19 AM,"package called > data sent to players > new player logs in > ""I cant see the package on the map""",,
