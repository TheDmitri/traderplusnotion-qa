235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:32 AM,but raycastProxy,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:32 AM,and you can set type to ALLObjects,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:32 AM,so it will return everything,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:32 AM,I think per default it's first contact,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:33 AM,Or maybe the last parameter of raycastRv,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:33 AM,sounds a type of CollisionFlags,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:34 AM,Ok thanks a lot,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:36 AM,hmm I dont see any raycastProxy in script sources,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:42 AM,"using Particle pe = Particle.PlayInWorld(ParticleList.DEBUG_DOT, endPos); now to see where actual hits are and it helps a lot",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:44 AM,You can use raycastRV,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:44 AM,it's the last parameter,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:45 AM,CollisionFlags,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:45 AM,"You are right, grass doesn't stop ray",,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:45 AM,I made something wrong before,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,05/16/2020 12:45 AM,grass doesn't have view geo,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:46 AM,Yeah when I visualized all positions with PS debug I was able to fix it,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:46 AM,thanks a lot,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:46 AM,Grass was not a problem,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:46 AM,I put end point off player pos,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 12:47 AM,"I will probably make three ray checks - one on player pos, second on head bone pos and third between",,

In the wiki it does not explain the role of functions. Thank",,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:02 AM,I found nothing like that so far @Dean Porter mainly searching exctracted P: drive for clues,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:03 AM,Ok thank you so you have to delve into the code to understand the mechanics?,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:06 AM,yep there is basic language reference but very vague,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:06 AM,https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:06 AM,for actual API stuff you need dvelve into P: drive scripts folder,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:09 AM,Too bad to have provided the script kit without providing the manual Thank @ataribaby,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:10 AM,"well Enforce itself is great step forward in compared to old arma SQF, at least everything makes sense and works in mostly usual way - objects and inheritance.",,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:11 AM,I usualy text serach *.c files inside p: drive scripts folder for text that i think should be there,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:11 AM,to start somewhere,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:11 AM,Using Total Commander search function for this,,

317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:12 AM,no such wiki,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:12 AM,there is some machine generated class docs,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:13 AM,but it is not very helpful as it has no description how stuff works,,

317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:14 AM,WOW,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:14 AM,i saw differnt class docs that was just machine generated,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:14 AM,"this is great, thanks @thurston",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,05/16/2020 2:15 AM,"Not a problem. As far as I know, the majority of us just look through P:\Scripts though, a lot (not all iirc) of functions inside of there are either self explanatory or do have documentation.",,

689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:20 AM,Thanks @thurston,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:20 AM,its part of fun,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:21 AM,also what was very helpful to find simillar mod and unpack it to look inside how it was done,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:21 AM,I learned some stuff like that,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:21 AM,Yes i think i will start searching the files to understand,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:21 AM,larning curve is way faster for me than Arma SQF stuff tbh,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:22 AM,as Enforce is like more mature language,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:22 AM,If I look at existing tutorials sqf arma sa little help?,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:22 AM,If I look at existing sqf arma tutorials can that help?,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,05/16/2020 2:22 AM,"No, you'll be going reverse in my honest opinion.",,
230061386888118273,.thurston,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,SQF and EnScript are nothing alike,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,Ok,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,forget about arma and SQF,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,^,,
230061386888118273,.thurston,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,I hate SQF with a passion.,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,maybe some config and modeling knowledge is nice to have but language itself is more like managed C#,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:23 AM,I examine the Vpp admin / Zomberry mods that I download to examine the code,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:25 AM,It's ok for the code I'm good in C ++ its looks like C # for the code I have a lot of concepts to tell the truth it's rather the usefulness of the functions,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:27 AM,I understood the concept of the OnUpdate functions which runs in loop on the program or OnInit etccc,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:28 AM,I wanted to understand the Server / Gameplay / Base mission classes,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:29 AM,Thanks for your information it helps me a lot it's nice to you guys,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:30 AM,well if you want plug in your stuff just extend class you need and override functions. Don't forget to call super. to execute original function except cases it is desired behaviour to cut original code,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:30 AM,or modded class,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:31 AM,it is in that basic enforce reference I pasted above and you will find a lot of examples in p:,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:31 AM,Do I understand super is to execute the constructor of the parent class?,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:31 AM,yep,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:31 AM,Ok good,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:32 AM,super.OnUpdate() and you pass original params,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:32 AM,timeslice i think in this case,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:32 AM,Yes (timesplice),,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:32 AM,yep,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:33 AM,you can extend classes from config so you can add code to 3d objects and so on,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:34 AM,i have this 3d objects in config.cpp,,

689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:35 AM,Just an information what is the role of the Mission base / gameplay / server classes,,

689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:39 AM,what is the time slice for?,,

317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:39 AM,it is delta time from last update,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:39 AM,As I am French this word speaks to me less sorry if my question seems stupid,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:39 AM,so you need accumulate it to get running timer,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:39 AM,timeslice is like deltatime,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:40 AM,in float seconds,,

317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:40 AM,here I accumulate till it is 5 sec,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:40 AM,one frame can be 0.06 or so for example,,
689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:41 AM,Basically it is a graduation to be located in time?,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:41 AM,yes you need add it to get running time,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:41 AM,it is only delta from previous frame,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:41 AM,not a total,,
317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:42 AM,just print it and you will see,,

317362949037752331,ataribaby,05/16/2020 2:42 AM,you will see it in script log or in enfusion IDE maybe,,

689520700528394356,Dean Porter#1263,05/16/2020 2:43 AM,Yes i understood i would print to understand exactly the mechanics,,

@Helkhiana

Yeah thats what i meant with config ""values"" 
But i want to restrict the item to be ""shouldered"" if it has any quantity over 1. I want to make ""pipes"" stackable, the problem is, that he shoulders all of them. so a bool like: CanBeShouldered() would be nice. like the CanReceiveInCargo or something.
