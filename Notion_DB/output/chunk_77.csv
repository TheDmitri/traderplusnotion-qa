272245679013888011,marioe,01/31/2021 12:59 PM,If the action doesn't play the animation and it just ends abruptly then your conditions are messed up or your callback is,,

The way I understand it is that some item can have different hiddenSelections in the array, where the index corresponds to the index in the hiddenSelectionsTextures/Materials array. When I use SetObjectMaterial(index, path) what is exactly happening? do I just update which texture is used with the specified index? If so, how do I actually control which material is shown on my item in game?",,

Right now, shutting down the smoke is easy, I still have to turn it off before activating it again.

Trying to change new spawn loadouts.

I have been searching, reading, and watching youtube videos for 8 hours now. I cant find a simple answer to change the starting load out to something relatively simple. There is information for randomized loadouts using arrays, etc. That is not what I am after, I am trying to have one generous load out on my server. 

I have pieced together examples from several different sources i have found and cannot get this init.c file to work. My server restarts but I can't log in. If anyone could help, provide a link to better references than what I have found, it would be much appreciated.

The intent is to have a new player spawn with the pistol in the holster with suppressor and mag attached; with a courier bag with radio (with battery), and chem light in those slots, and with those clothes with those items inside the jacket.

If anyone can point me in the correct direction it would be much appreciated.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/808690454921084958/not_working_init.c,
