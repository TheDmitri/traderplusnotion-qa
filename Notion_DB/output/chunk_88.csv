Trying to modify an existing little mod by switching one action and altering a very few variables. Guess I do it the wrong way. 
I've extracted the mod with PBO Manager, edited what I needed with Notepad ++, repacked it with PBO Manager, signed it with DayZ Tools. (here's one part I'm not sure about. I had to put in an authority, chose a random name and kept the created bisign file in the directory. I kept the original key, which seems to be ok, since the mod I modified is based off an outdated mod and used the old key as well). Uploaded everything to Steam via Publisher. 
Now when I try to run the mod the crashlog says
scripts/1_Core: Path not found
which is kind of no surprise since the mod only contains files for 3 and 4.
Client side now says mod is corrupted. So I guess that's not the right way to modify a mod at all, is it?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,05/16/2021 11:02 AM,"Your mod structure is either wrong, or you have a syntax error with your scripts. Either way, your packing method should not rely on PBOManager. You should use AddonBuilder (or go the full mile and get setup with MikerosDOSTools #tools-dayz )

Also, if you are going to reupload content (does not matter if the author is active / inactive) you will be breaking EULA of the steam workshop. 
You can instead create your own mod, which utilizes the steam dependency system, along with correct usage of overriding / overloading mods, this way you can make use of Enforce to mod those original classes. I suggest you find a workshop mod that achieves that (a few i can think of you can check here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2395118966&searchtext=VanillaPlusPlusMap)",,
