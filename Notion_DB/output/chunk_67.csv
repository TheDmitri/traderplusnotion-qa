@Landum idk how MedicalAttention implemented the ""drunkenness"", I suppose he created a new `Modifier` and then `OnActivate` and `OnDeactivate` manages the PPEffects; that's how I did some of my effects for the epinephrine.
But if you want to add shakes or something, you'll probably have to play around with the `Camera` of the player. There should be a method called `CamShake()` or something, I don't remember, but I'd suggest you to make your own implementation with the camera tranformation matrix",,
312948232021868545,landum,10/22/2020 12:03 PM,Yeah thats how he did it,,
312948232021868545,landum,10/22/2020 12:03 PM,But i didn't find any mention of PPEffects on the files actually,,

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,10/24/2020 6:09 PM,sue me BI,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,10/24/2020 6:10 PM,"so dumb, why don't they have a permissions system or some config to enable/disable write to currentdir?",,
171256035296673793,antihax,10/24/2020 6:18 PM,Is that the same directory with the server executable and such?,,
171256035296673793,antihax,10/24/2020 6:19 PM,"that would be a pretty good reason why, if so.",,

225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,10/24/2020 6:42 PM,so now EXP has changed the SetActions in playerbase... what was the purpose of this?? such a pain in the ass now i have to go change aLL of my mods to match the new SetActions,,
225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,10/24/2020 6:42 PM,so damn frustrating,,
225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,10/24/2020 6:43 PM,"it was ```    void SetActions()
    {
        AddAction(ActionOpenDoors);
..and so on...
}``` now its ```    void SetActions(out TInputActionMap InputActionMap)
    {
        AddAction(ActionOpenDoors, InputActionMap);
and so on...}```",,
171256035296673793,antihax,10/24/2020 6:45 PM,you could prob write a regex to do it if you have a significant amount,,
171256035296673793,antihax,10/24/2020 6:45 PM,vscode will let you do it over multiple files,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/24/2020 6:49 PM,Only thing with that is when the minor updates and hot fixes comes through @Kegan,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/24/2020 6:49 PM,You‚Äôll have to repatch it,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/24/2020 6:50 PM,Or you could just setup a pattern and patch it without modifying the executable like a normal person,,
