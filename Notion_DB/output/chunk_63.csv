235718406492520448,niirozz,08/29/2020 10:44 AM,IF you want to know if it's real thread,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,08/29/2020 10:44 AM,just use while (true) {},,
235718406492520448,niirozz,08/29/2020 10:45 AM,and you will see if your game will be locked or not,,
292234618667663361,kyhbka,08/29/2020 2:03 PM,Where i can find all variants? `set:playstation_buttons image:circle`,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 2:43 PM,"> anyone know where the standard vanilla heli crash script is found?
@DannyDoomno1 all there is to vanilla heli scripts: ```class Wreck_UH1Y extends House
{
    Particle m_ParticleEfx;
    void Wreck_UH1Y()
    {
        if ( !GetGame().IsMultiplayer() || GetGame().IsClient() )
        {
            m_ParticleEfx = Particle.PlayOnObject(ParticleList.SMOKING_HELI_WRECK, this, Vector(-0.5, 0, -1.0));
        }
    }
    
    override void EEDelete(EntityAI parent)
    {
        if ( !GetGame().IsMultiplayer() || GetGame().IsClient() )
        {
            if ( m_ParticleEfx )

265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 2:50 PM,I more meant the code for it spawning in,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 2:51 PM,with all the loot ect,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 2:53 PM,CLE handles that...i've no clue whether you can poke around with that at all,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 2:53 PM,the only thing you can set is what loot it spawns in the server's xml files,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 4:02 PM,well iv almost got it all exactly how I want,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 4:03 PM,I have but one issue... when running the mission I give it an X Y Z for the mission triggers.... but the Y changes per mission because of the terrain height... I could get every height manually... but I really dont want to...,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 4:03 PM,do you know how I can pull the Y coord of the ground at a given X/Z coord?,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,08/29/2020 4:39 PM,@DannyDoomno1 GetGame().SurfaceY();,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 4:39 PM,yup! I just finished the code to get these printed so I can pop em in the config,,
158294510080753665,gravitywolf,08/29/2020 4:40 PM,👍,,
265198066255134720,dannydoomno1,08/29/2020 4:41 PM,thank you though 🙂 I wish there was documentation for this stuff,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:02 PM,heya...i was wondering...you know how some objects display their name as you click on them in the single player editor? i was wondering if it's possible to configure the rest of the objects to show as well...(talking about non-proxy objects),,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:09 PM,Use BuilderItems. He defines a number of static objects allowing to grab the name of the model. Not all though,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:14 PM,"i know of the mod...but even with it installed, i'm no closer to what i wanna do",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:14 PM,What are you trying to do? Let’s start there.,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:15 PM,i'm trying to attach a script to every instance of the placed object,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:15 PM,"If it’s static, it’s not gonna happen.",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:15 PM,"by static, you mean?",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:16 PM,Objects in world that are part of the map that are NOT defined under cfgVehicles.,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:16 PM,yea...they do seem to be static in that case....but why wouldn't simply defining them work?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:17 PM,Most static items don’t have view geo and the likes. So it’s wonky and unreliable. What kind of script are you attempting? Actions?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:17 PM,Removal?,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:18 PM,"yea, something like that",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:18 PM,a nice idea sparked by that question would be destruction of walls,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:18 PM,couldn't do it for the same reason...the wall just doesn't know it's a wall,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:18 PM,Better luck with objects NoT inside a building. But static objects inside a building are a crap shoot as they may not have view geo or the building geo over laps it.,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:20 PM,"yea...that's why i was talking about objects not related to buildings...i was messing around with proxies the other day and it worked for most of the tools like the grinder, saw,...but didn't work well for the vending machines for example",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:20 PM,thought it could work in a similar way for these other objects,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:21 PM,"> Most static items don’t have view geo and the likes.

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:22 PM,I went a diff route as it was very cumbersome and irregular. So I spawn invis objects on those items and use those to target.,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:22 PM,with MySomeItem having empty res lod and a view geo lod,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,"say if i wanted to spawn, for example, a light blub on every lamp on the map....would it be doable for static lamps?",,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,Yes,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,Yes.,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,Though doing it at *every* lamp will cause light issues in some areas with many,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,as the game has a limit to how many lights it can render,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,yea..there's a limit to 50ish per camera,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,so you will get flashy effect as they fight,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:23 PM,512 for the map,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:24 PM,"No limit for the map I dont think, we have well over 512",,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:24 PM,i'm 100% sure i read about the limit,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:24 PM,In some outdated comment in script?,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:24 PM,I dont disbelieve you read it but I am 90% sure its wrong,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:25 PM,probably a different type of light idk,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/749348947557875782/unknown.png,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:25 PM,Especially since your client wont even know lights past 1km exist,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:26 PM,Maybe 512 per client but I dont see why ones not in camera matter,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,08/29/2020 9:26 PM,So that would be 512 per square km,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:26 PM,i wouldn't know...,,
239723354657914880,maroonchy,08/29/2020 9:26 PM,but how would i go at this light bulb problem?,,

207902577713479680,simonvic,09/02/2020 4:55 PM,I'm now looking at how firearms evaluate the effect and sound based on the material,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,09/02/2020 5:30 PM,id assume it's something engine side evaluating the effect,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/02/2020 5:33 PM,don't believe there is a way to get the material,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/02/2020 5:33 PM,maybe through the component index you might be able to,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,09/02/2020 5:34 PM,but you'll have to trace against the firegeom probably,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,09/02/2020 6:39 PM,Otherwise try GetSurfaceSomething ... I think it was Type. That only works well when you care about the material seen from the top. Doesn't help with looking at the object sideways,,

207902577713479680,simonvic,09/02/2020 7:23 PM,I've also tried with damage zones... no luck. Well I guess I'll drop the idea for the moment. Thanks everybody for the help 😄,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,09/02/2020 10:12 PM,use `ObjIntersectFire`,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,09/02/2020 10:12 PM,and that will raycast fire geo @simonvic,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,09/02/2020 10:12 PM,then you can grab the component and check the materials for a glass rvmat,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,09/03/2020 6:52 AM,So mine doesn’t provide  safety in a zone persay. But punishes players for hurting or killing other players in a defined area. I can customize it a little for you. But it’ll you basically define a pos as your ‘safezone’ then define a radius around it. Then define a ‘jail’ for the assailant to be transported to (with uncon effect),,

Will have to change some code/script yeah? As there rvmat etc!  But is that legal to do? I think so haha I have been over all licences not all making sense but the mi8 heli sample for example I could port that from arma same as they have but make it not be dependent on expansion yes?  Keep in mind 2weeks ago I knew nothing about scripting etc but have been learning fast!and grinding flat out and I will not stop  dayz community needs this if any one can help me/suggestions/tools etc would be great didn't want to keep bothering exp Dev. Thanks,,
