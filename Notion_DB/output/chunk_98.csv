137658517615149056,helkhiana,08/19/2021 3:30 AM,same thing,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,08/19/2021 3:36 AM,i think its just due to how templates work,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,08/19/2021 3:36 AM,templating does not carry the `ref` quite like you think it would when passing it like that,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,08/19/2021 3:37 AM,its expecting `myPClass.loc` to be `ref array<MyType>`,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,08/19/2021 3:37 AM,since the InsertArray parameters probably accept an argument of type `array<T>`,,

272245679013888011,marioe,08/22/2021 7:16 AM,This is the main issue with RPCs and enums and why CF is needed,,
