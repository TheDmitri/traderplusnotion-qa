135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/21/2020 4:31 PM,that `= true` means that if you dont give it a variable. its going to automatically assume its true,,
135226527473336320,inclementdab,11/21/2020 4:31 PM,which means you can call it without the parameter. hence `super.OnChangeCharacter();` is valid,,

Even flat-out *removed* most of the changed code from 1.10 and we were still having major degradation over approximately 2-3 hours, and starting at about 50% of our 1.09 server FPS levels.
