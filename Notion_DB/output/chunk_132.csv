It should be taken in hand, have 1 type (box) on a variety of objects, compare another when unfolding, but at the same time when you close this ""container"", its contents could not be viewed until you open it. Something like that.",,

I could need some advice, or if someone has done it already, some examples too 😄 
I am working on a PKP atm. Have finished the Models, the configs and so on.
But i would like to have a extra mechanic around the ammo for it.
Since it is feed from a ammo belt out of a Box magazine, i don't want it to take normal 7.62x54 ammo.
I made a separate ammo variant that has chain links from that ammo belt on them.
i want that players need to craft this ammo out of the normal 7.62x54 cartridge and the links of the ammo belt that ppl are also supposed to be able to find.
now, i also want, this crafting to be a continuous action, like loading a magazine. one short circle subtracts one bullet and one chain link from the inventory, and adds one of the 7.62x54 belt cartridge to the inventory.
now, normal crafting recipes are never continuous and only converts the stack. if i use that, i run into the problem, that a combination basically always generates a full stack unless i put a set limit and it also always consumes the full stack no matter how much/little is in the stack of the ingredients unless i set an arbitrary requirement... so normal crafting sucks ass for this.
I would also like to have an action to split the belt cartridge again into the chain link and ammo... also continuous.

I am still a noob at scripting. any advice and help would be greatly appreciated.",,

Basically hiding a slot of both, but your still able to attach both scope variants.

I made something similar now with a cooker and ingredient slots.

```
override bool CanDisplayAttachmentSlot( string slot_name )
    {    
        if ( slot_name == ""Ingredient1"")                                    
        {                                                                    
            return this.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""Ingredient1"") != NULL;    
        }
        
        if ( slot_name == ""Ingredient2"")
        {
            return this.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""Ingredient1"") == NULL;    
        }      
        return true;
    }```

I have a 3rd ingredient now and wanted to have the same effect, but I always had weird situations, where the attached item didnt show up anymore as attached, even tho it was and also been shown proxy wise.
Or had it where it was next to the ingredient slot showing up.

How would I make this script to work for up to 3 ingredients and eventually a explanation to extend it to more slots.

(Have multiple slots, cause all have different proxy positions to work nice on the cooker)",,

Right now we are getting ready to switch to winter chernarus on our Memento Mori server. I am curently making adjustments to make the winter survival aspect more difficult. and I want to freez the water pumps around the map. But the Namalsk Servival mod has a script for managing filling bottles at the wells and not haveing them frozen. This is making any atempt to disable the pumps not work. for some reason I can always fill a bottle. 
I feel like I need to create a script to override the Namalsk script, without breaking other aspects of the mod.  but Im not sure how to go about it. Anyone what to try helping?
The script in question is ""ActionFillBottleBase.c""",,

but the mod doesn't have a cut healing feature.
The mod is configured using a Json file. There are two adjustment parameters for applying cuts in a Json file:
```""Enable_Bleeding_Add"": 0,
""Bleeding_Add_Value"": 0,```
Part of the mod code:
```if(Setting.Enabled_Config)
    {
    private bool Enable_Bleeding_Add = Setting.Enable_Bleeding_Add;
    private int Bleeding_Add_Value = Setting.Bleeding_Add_Value;
       if(result_search == ""true"")
      {
        WriteDebugLog(""Search items is founded! Try Apply actions! "" + GetPlayerLogIdentify(player));
        if(Enable_Bleeding_Add)
        {
        private int get_BleedingBits = player.GetBleedingBits(); // уровень кровотека
        //player.SetBleedingBits(get_BleedingBits + 1);
        BleedingSourcesManagerServer BSMgr = player.GetBleedingManagerServer();
        //if (BSMgr.AttemptAddBleedingSource(Math.RandomInt(0, 100))) break;
        //private int apply_BleedingBits_value = Math.RandomInt(0, Bleeding_Add_Value);
        private int apply_BleedingBits_value = Bleeding_Add_Value;
        if (BSMgr.AttemptAddBleedingSource(apply_BleedingBits_value)) break;
        /*

        AttemptAddBleedingSource(int component)

        WriteDebugLog(""Add Bleeding value '"" + apply_BleedingBits_value.ToString() + ""' to player! "" + GetPlayerLogIdentify(player));
