so im having an item that uses translationY to animate a item going from  Phase 0 to Phase 1 (in Y axis) 
all good so far by using the SetAnimationPhase in a function and have it set to 1 = item goes directly to phase 1, 

so my question is are there a way to go thru all phases so it looks more like the item going up and not just pop to the top? 
its my first time i use class Animations so i may missed something. thanks

456226577798135808,Deleted User,08/03/2021 1:59 PM,You can get the position of the player by calling GetPosition() on the player object. Then you can add your distance vector to it and create the object at that position,,

But you can get the direction of the player using GetDirection() as well and use some math to calculate the position being like 2m in front of s player for example,,

tried looking for resources online too and its not exactly what im looking for. only thing i was told was that its ""not recommended"" but it must be possible, i hear abt other servers having custom tiers all the time and i dont hear abt it  being an issue, just cant find detailed instructions on what pieces need changing, in what way, and all the parts needed to make it function the way i need.
ive edited the AreaFlags.map to include a new tier, painted the area, added a flag in the xml for Tier5 and flagged that new tier with that new flag, and saved it to a new AreaFlags.map and double checked it to make sure everything matched up to what the other tiers looked like. input a and b both showed Tier5 properly so i moved the AreaFlags.map over to my test server, changed the cfglimitsdefinition.xml to include Tier5, and changed cfglimitsdefinitionuser.xml to include the different combinations including T5. saved everything, loaded my test server with a fresh storage_1, and checked my map for where certain guns marked with Tier5 were spawning, and it was pretty incorrect. It didnt seem like it was following any sort of tier at all in the process of spawning the guns marked with Tier5, meaning i feel like im missing a piece somewhere or maybe i didnt set it up properly",,
