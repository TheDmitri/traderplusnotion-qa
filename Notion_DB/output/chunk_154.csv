When I remove the mod, the server starts up and launches normally.  I followed a couple videos I was able to find and compared it to some other recipe mods I peeked at to understand the file structure, so I don't know why mine isn't working.  The PluginRecipesManager.c file is just kind of sitting in the mod with nothing else calling it in the config.c or anywhere else so I don't know how the server knows to read it.",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:41 PM,well for once your `object` is always null you never assign the variable,,
173448803578281984,inkihh,05/29/2023 1:42 PM,what does GetVehicleOnPlatform() return?,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:42 PM,return CarScript from it,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:42 PM,if inherited from carscript just return car,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:42 PM,You can do it even easier. always attempt to cast to CarScript. if it is not carscript it will be null,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:43 PM,but if the cased object is not null return from that method,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,05/29/2023 1:43 PM,and continue in your simulation disable code where you get the car that is currently on the lift,,

Or what could be a good alternative except modifiers? (to not break other mods)

Here is what I'm trying to do:
1. I have a health injector, it can be injected
2. Upon injection the `OnApply` method is called
3. Then I want to give `10%` of max health in `3` seconds
4. I need to subtract these `10%` of original `100%` quantity of injector and repeat same action in 3 seconds
5. When quantity is <=0% it should stop

Problem: `InjectorAction` is not even called because this item is deleted upon injection 😦

```C++
class my_health_injector: my_injector_base
{
    const int ACTION_DELAY = 3000;
    const float QUANTITY_START = 1.0;
    const float QUANTITY_DELTA = 0.1;

    override void OnApply(PlayerBase player)
    {
        auto params = new Param2<PlayerBase, float>(player, QUANTITY_START);
        auto callQueue = GetGame().GetCallQueue(CALL_CATEGORY_SYSTEM);
        callQueue.CallLater(InjectorAction, ACTION_DELAY, false, params);
    };

    void InjectorAction(Param2<PlayerBase, float> params)

        auto player = params.param1;
        auto quantity = params.param2;

        auto maxHealth = player.GetMaxHealth("""", """");

207902577713479680,simonvic,06/01/2023 10:32 AM,"I'm copypasting an explanation I gave for my framework, but the logic still applies to how vanilla PPEffects work

Let's say you have these two sPPEffects
```csharp
class Effect_A : SPPEffect {
  override void onInit() {
    op(PPOperator.SET);
    priority(1);
    setVignetteIntensity(0.69);
  }
}

class Effect_B : SPPEffect {
  override void onInit() {
    op(PPOperator.ADD);
    priority(2);
    setVignetteIntensity(1.0);
  }
}
```
**Each of the parameter you set (e.g. vignette intensity, chromatic aberration, radial blur etc.) are like a LAYER on PHOTOSHOP
A layer interacts with all the underlying layers.**

You have to define the ""order"" of these layers via the `priority(int)` method.
Higher priority means that the layer will be on top of those with lower priority.

In this example,  `Effect_B vignette layer` will be on top of the vignette intensity layer of `Effect_A vignette layer`.
`Effect_A vignette layer` will be on top of the `default vignette layer`, since there are no other `vignette layer` active

the way the `Effect_B vignette layer` interacts with `Effect_A vignette layer` is defined via the `operator` which can be set with the `op()` method.

In this example, `Effect_A vignette layer` interacts with `default vignette layer` with the `SET` operator, which means it will ignore lower layers, and set the vignette to 0.69
`Effect_B vignette layer` interacts with `Effect_A vignette layer` with the `ADD` operator, which means it will sum the values
```
^
| result vignette   = 1.69
| Effect_B vignette = 1.0
| ADD
| Effect_A vignette = 0.69
| SET
| default vignette = 0
```

A list of `PPOperators` can be found here: https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Script-Diff/blob/main/scripts/3_game/ppemanager/ppeconstants.c#L50-L64
I'll update the tutorial on sPPEffect on the website, to provide a better explanation for each of these.
_ _
The priority and the operator can be set for each parameter
```csharp
class Effect_C : SPPEffect {
  override void onInit() {
    op(PPOperator.ADD);
    priority(69);
    setVignetteIntensity(1.0);

    op(PPOperator.MULTIPLICATIVE);
    priority(420);
    setChromAber(0.5);
  }
}
```
in this example, the `Effect_C` will have the following parameters:
```
| parameter name     | value | priority | operator       |
|--------------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| vignette intensity | 1.0   | 69       | ADD            |
| chromatic aber.    | 0.5   | 420      | MULTIPLICATIVE |
```
The `Effect_C vignette layer` will interact with other vignette layers with lower priority with the ADD operator
The `Effect_C chrom aber layer` will interact with other chrom aber layers with lower priority with the MULTIPLICATIVE operator
_ _
You also get a new method: `normalized(true/false)` which will define if each parameter value is or is not normalized; if `normalized(true)`, the values you pass to the setters (e.g. `setVignetteIntensity()`, `setChromAber()`) are expected to be in range of 0.0 - 1.0
where 0.0 is the mininum and 1.0 the maximum value of that parameter.

The minimum and maximum value depends on the parameter.
For the vignette effect, the minimum is 0.0 and maximum 2.0
While for the chromatic aberration the minium is 0.0 and the maximum is 0.05

# TL;DR
set a higher `priority_layer` than all other effects, and choose the appropriate `PPOperator` to decide how your value will interact with other effects (with lower priority)",,❤️‍🔥 (2)

I receive from serverside an RPC with json-string that deserializes into map from QuestManager class.
Inside this func I can easily access to deserialized data, but it is destroyed after func is over.

330475826158108674,mikkbenelis,06/07/2023 7:22 PM,"Is it possible to somehow test entity/action synchronization without the second player?
For some reason my code is not getting synced (still figuring out why) and I want to test the updated one
I found that basic reconnect is a relatively good test, but it is not really helpful in this case

Short description of a problem:
1. I have a music player, it has some tracks and active track index
2. While I'm alone it works fine, even after reconnect its state is synced
3. But if someone else is switching the track index it gets desynced

Here is how it works:

1. I have an action to switch track with this code:
```C++
override void OnExecute(ActionData action_data) // tried OnExecuteClient as well
{
    auto item = ItemBase.Cast(action_data.m_MainItem);
    auto audioPlayer = audio_player_base.Cast(item);
    if (audioPlayer) audioPlayer.NextTrack();
}```
2. Audio player has some network variables like:
```C++
protected bool m_IsPlaying = false;
protected int m_CurrentTrackIndex = 0;
...
RegisterNetSyncVariableBool(""m_IsPlaying"");
RegisterNetSyncVariableInt(""m_CurrentTrackIndex"");```
3. `NextTrack` is:
```C++
void NextTrack()
{
    ++m_CurrentTrackIndex;
    if (m_CurrentTrackIndex >= m_Tracks.Count())
        m_CurrentTrackIndex = 0;

    SetSynchDirty();
    Play();
}```
4. `Play` is:
```C++
void Play()
{
    Stop();

    if (GetGame().IsClient())
    {
        auto soundSet = m_Tracks[m_CurrentTrackIndex];
        m_Track = SEffectManager.CreateSound(soundSet, GetPosition());
        m_Track.SetAutodestroy(true);
        m_Track.SetParent(this);
        m_Track.SoundPlay();
    }

    m_IsPlaying = true;
    SetSynchDirty();
}```
5. `Stop` is:
```C++
void Stop()
{
    m_IsPlaying = false;
    SetSynchDirty();

    if (m_Track)
        m_Track.SoundStop();
}```",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/07/2023 7:31 PM,`OnVariablesSynchronized` is called on the client after setsynchdirty is called,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/07/2023 7:32 PM,this is where you should handle your logic when syncing the track index and play state,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,06/07/2023 7:32 PM,"`OnExecute` should only change the index and play state, not actually play music",,

330475826158108674,mikkbenelis,06/07/2023 7:37 PM,"So am I right that it should look like this:
1. `OnExecute`  (or `OnExecuteClient` is better?) will trigger the `NextTrack`
2. `NextTrack` will switch `m_CurrentTrackIndex` and `SetSynchDirty()`
3. In `OnVariablesSynchronized` I need to handle the new track index",,
