There is a 70% chance currently if my action will be executed. If not I want it to play the soundset.

``void PlayChainsawFailStart`` is called in ``void OnExecuteServer`` and ``void OnExecuteClient``.

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,06/27/2023 9:34 AM,"Here is a suggestion from my side:

Add a dummy ammo type to any of your config.cpp:
```c++
class CfgAmmo
{
    class MeleeFist_Heavy;
    class MeleeFist_HeavyDummy: MeleeFist_Heavy
    {
        hitAnimation = 1;  // this makes it so that the stumble animation is played!!
        class DamageApplied
        {
            type = ""Melee"";
            class Health
            {
                damage = 0;
                armorDamage = 0;
            };
            class Blood
            {
                damage = 0;
            };
            class Shock
            {
                damage = 0;
            };
        };
    };
};
```
And from script side you simply apply the infliction of damage from the dummy ammo type on the player:
```c++
PlayerBase player = <the player instance you want to inflict the dummy damage>;
DamageSystem.CloseCombatDamageName(player, player, player.GetHitComponentForAI(), ""MeleeFist_HeavyDummy"", player.GetPosition());
```",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,06/27/2023 9:36 AM,The issue with starting commands is that its needs to be synchronized with server and client or the player will desynchronize with the server. So you either need to make sure you sync it yourself or you use mechanics that perform the synchronization for you already (which is the case for above suggestion),,
277431897133678593,tuimz,06/27/2023 10:32 AM,"Related to above maybe, does that also include stopping actions? I start an action  at an object and if I interrupt it by letting go of the mouse button it messes up the players hands. Which can be resolved by jumping but is less then ideal",,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,06/27/2023 12:21 PM,This will only make the animation play on the client for the controlling player and it will de synchronize it with the server,,

I tried to solve that by EEHitBy method, but always, i get opposite effect, when eAI hit me, it says, that player has that item attached.. but i need to see this, when i will hit enemy. 

my code:

What i can do different please?

EEHitBy method:

```c
PlayerBase target = PlayerBase.Cast(this);  // Z√≠sk√°n√≠ zasa≈æen√©ho hr√°ƒçe
        if (target)
        {
            
            if (target.IsUrukRaceAttached())
            {
                GetGame().ChatPlayer(""Player has equipped"");
            }
            else
            {
                GetGame().ChatPlayer(""Player does not have equipped"");
            }
        }```


and method **IsUrukRaceAttached()**
```c
bool IsUrukRaceAttached()
    {
        EntityAI urukRace = GetInventory().FindAttachment(InventorySlots.GetSlotIdFromString(""Race""));
        if (urukRace && urukRace.GetType() == ""mefa_Race_Uruk_Hai"")
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }```

my goal is something like LIFESTEAL effect, that is not problem, but i need to check this moment, when player hit enemy and in same time player has attached my custom item ""mefa_Race_Uruk_Hai""

Hope it is clear üôÇ

i tried different settings with adding **this.IsUrukRaceAttached()** | **player.IsUrukRaceAttached()** etc., but always almost same result.

So GOAL:

When enemy is hit - check if player has attached custom item, when yes, do something. (this time i got always opposite effect, when enemy hit me.)
