Is there any chance to make a custom dynamic event with multiple objects?
Like train crash with multiple wagons.
I have seen it on a server but i dont have any ideas how to do that",,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/08/2022 7:40 AM,Couple ways to do it. You could create a new model that is just a bunch of proxies of the train cars in how ever the order you want them. Then just spawn that custom object with your event. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/08/2022 4:33 PM,Is that an existing way to make custom object spawns on server starts?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,03/08/2022 4:35 PM,You mean like DayZ editor loader? Or init.c method using ‚ÄòSpawnObjectHelper‚Äô ?,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,03/08/2022 4:53 PM,The former. I've seen the config files for mapgrouppos but haven't dived into customizing them (or if its even possible),,

214154100080640001,r22rstern,03/08/2022 6:27 PM,or you can't at all attach anything? Because doing that (unless your model is the exact same) is a bad idea since proxies might not attach the same,,
460539244923060256,caesarvi,03/08/2022 6:27 PM,yep i tried create helmet.c in Entites in 4_World for my helmet by this sample but it doesnt worked,,

704610313625927730,grotzz,03/08/2022 9:30 PM,"hi all...i'm starting to code a little on dayz scripts....and i'm stuck on something....
I'm trying to make a code to allow just admins of the server to use a admin construction tool that can build construction parts faster and without materials....

the code is the one below....
the problem:
- the print that is on the code is being activated on the log properly (it finds the user steam ID)
- but its raising an exception:

`Myserver/scripts/4_World/adminhatchet.c:7

`

Code:
`
    override bool CanBuildPart( string part_name, ItemBase tool, bool use_tool )
    {
        
        Man ctg_player = GetGame().GetPlayer();
        PlayerIdentity ctgIdentity = ctg_player.GetIdentity();
        
        if (tool.GetType() == ""MyMod_AdminHatchet"")
        {
            if ( !IsPartConstructed( part_name ) && !HasConflictPart( part_name ) && HasRequiredPart( part_name ))
            {
                PrintString(""[ADMIN HATCHET] Used by player SteamID="" + ctgIdentity.GetPlainId());

            }

I'm using a mod for traders and i wanted to add some taxes that can be collected, so i think i can add some modification (in another mod) to the trader mod, i'll just add a line that takes a % of the price of an item and it need to be sent to a server side mod that store the value in a json file.
And later on, someone can come and collect it with a simple action

I think I can handle everything except one thing, and it's how can I send the value to my server side mod or even get a value from the server (i'm not talking about writing/reading in the json file, I'm talking about communication between player / server)

The json file would be something like that : 

```json
{
    ""TraderID"" : {
        ""TaxToCollect"" : 3242,
        ""CanCollect"" : [
            ""UID"",

I have a problem with my crafts. The problem is that I want to combine two items together so civilansedandoors_driver with a paint can that allows me to get color1

I finished my script and all that, the black doors can not be painted black, same with the white color and wine color (red) .

I redo the same procedure for my civilansedan_CoDriver but I realize that it will even seek the combination in civilansedandoors_DRIVER where I do not understand because my codrivers are not declared as craft in my drivers.

Is it the fact that I use the same second object to paint the door? I don't know I'm lost for help",,

    class StaticObject;
    class Static_wreck_s120_red: StaticObject{};

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/14/2022 1:54 AM,Apparently call later has issues on long running servers,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/14/2022 1:54 AM,Timer in this case would probably be the best use,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,03/14/2022 1:55 AM,you can also get the time and store that in db when the server is closing,,

But as general info, network variables are optimized as much as they can be. they are all put into a byte stream and not send as individual variables. so you can send multiple bools in the place of one int. If an int only requires 5 bits due to the quantization limits given then it will only take up 5 bits. However there are minimum sizes for the network sync packets and you have no control over what other data is being sent, so you can not make any assumption on the exact message size you will produce. Regardless you should try to use as little space as possible to increase the chance of your data fitting into an existing space so no additional bytes are used. e.g. if you know your integer will only ever have values between 0 and 100 ... then limit it to that range. Don't make the system think it could potentially be int.max. If you have lots of netsync variables this can have a meaningful impact.",,üëç (1)
181864632216977408,arkensor,03/14/2022 10:37 AM,"I would recommend to use a synced context like the game time, or simulation step number to tell clients when they will be allowed to use it again. you only need to set this value once on use to `now + 10 minutes` and then double check the action on the server side if that 10 minutes have passed since the last use. The client could simply bypass any local restrictions.

Or as @Wardog suggested simply set the bool ""usable"" true or false on the server and have a timer running every time the action is successfully executed. That should work out fine if you do not have too many of the items - otherwise the server gets bloated with running timers.",,

Few functions are really blocking for long enough to cause a problem there. Anything called from non blocking events does not need this anyway,,

i also tried a version on the Item itself

override bool CanPutInCargo( EntityAI parent )

        super.CanPutInCargo(parent);
        Print(""DAJECARGO"");
        if(!parent)

            return false;

        {
            PlayerBase pb = PlayerBase.Cast(parent);

                return false;
            ClothingBase patchRogue = ClothingBase.Cast(pb.GetItemOnSlot(""Armband""));

            return true;

2nd, ""multiple declarations""  This means you're declaring the variable more than once. You only need to declare the type (string in this instance) once. You can reuse/redefine it as many times as you'd like, but you can only type it out as `string DEFAULT_CHARACTER_NAME = ""text goes here"";` once.
