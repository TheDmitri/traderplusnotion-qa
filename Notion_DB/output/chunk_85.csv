135226527473336320,inclementdab,04/12/2021 10:47 AM,you want their max health to be adjusted or just set their health one time,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,04/12/2021 10:49 AM,thats pretty complicated compared to the first one,,
328299074266857475,spectramodz,04/12/2021 10:51 AM,But I can settle for the first thing I said,,

When i click place ingame, the hologram shows up correct, but after placing it's exactly 180¬∞ turned. 
I tried with **reversed=1;** in config.cpp and it works after placing, but it's 180¬∞ turned when clicking ""place"", so you have to scroll everytime which isn't a big thing, but ideally, i want it so it's popping up in the right direction. Any ideas?",,

207902577713479680,simonvic,04/15/2021 3:25 PM,"hey guys, I'm having having some trouble with my mods. Idk if I should ask this here, in #configs-dayz or #workbench-dayz 

I made two mods (`@myFirstMod` and `@mySecondMod`).
`@mySecondMod` overrides a method of `@myFristMod` and so far everything is alright.

I launch both the workbench and the game loading `@myFirstMod` first and then `@mySecondMod` like so:
> ""-mod=@myFirstMod;@mySecondMod""

> First mod
> ```csharp
> override void OnJumpStart(){        
>   super.OnJumpStart(); //this should call the game OnJumpStart()
>   SLog.d(""Hello from first mod"");
> }
> ```

> Second mod
> ```csharp
> override void OnJumpStart(){        
>   super.OnJumpStart(); //this should call the myFirstMod OnJumpStart()
>   SLog.d(""Hello from second mod"");
> }
> ```

problem 1:
one problem is that when I modify `@mySecondMod` and then try to *Recompile file on host* (file patching), it will change both  `@mySecondMod` and `@myFirstMod`.
I don't know if the problem is that I load both mods with the workbench or I'm missing something about how mods are loaded

~~problem 2:
if I want that myFirstMod super refers to the game, and mySecondMod super refers to the firstMod,
is `-mod=@myFirstMod;@mySecondMod ` the right way I should load my mods?-~~

problem 3:
in `@mySecondMod` I also override a method defined in `@myFirstMod`, so I thought that I would need to specify in the secondMod config.cpp the required addons like so:
```cpp
class CfgPatches {
    class mySecondMod{
        units[] = {};
        weapons[] = {};
        requiredVersion = 0.1;
        requiredAddons[] = {
            ""myFirstMod""
        };
    };
};
```
But if I don't specify myFirstMod in required addons, it works anyway with no error. Am I misunderstanding something here?",,
796109880183881788,MaD#6270,04/15/2021 4:09 PM,"I can only answer problem 3 (i think): it works because myFirstMod is loaded on your server, so all the classes and stuff are well defined and your mySecondMod  is able to find them, even though you did not specify into mySecondMod requiredAddons.
If you would specify requiredAddons with myFirstMod, and myFirstMod  would not be loaded, you would have an error I believe",,
207902577713479680,simonvic,04/15/2021 4:20 PM,"I should have specified that I've only tested this in an offline mission, so I'm pretty sure it could change something when playing on a real server.

Anyway, I've tried to load the game without loading myFirstMod (both specifying myFirstMod as a required addons, and not specifying it) and it gives me the same error message (it just can't find the classes and stuff obviously), but it doesn't tell me that I need to also load that specific addons. 
So what's the point in specifying the required addons?",,
