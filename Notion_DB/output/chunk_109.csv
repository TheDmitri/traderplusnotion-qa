144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,12/28/2021 1:34 AM,ok so what i would do is once your symptoms get to a certain point you can activate a modifier that modifier will spawn a zombie in close proximity at the same time it will also boost your visibility up to a crazy percentage for a short while guaranteeing instant aggro you then have a choice where you would like to call it either on the player or on the zombie that as the zombie hits the game checks the player to see if the modifier (or level of symptom) is active if so it would then run a chance base of deleting the zombie or at least thats how i would do it,,

726044916223967244,thcbdmt,12/28/2021 2:13 AM,"Hi Everyone, I am just starting to learn some modding. I have succesfully retextured and modified basic stats of vanilla clothing, Added new recipes.
I have also Imported my own blender models as static objects, but now I would like to learn some more scripting.
What I would like to do as a beginner project is to take my vending machine model and add an action so that using a crowbar will give a chance to spawn a drink.
So far I have tried using a crafting recipe to no avail(Maybe because Vending machine is a building ? but i dont think that is all there is to it)
I have been picking apart game files and found the following in ""well.c""

`class Well extends BuildingSuper
{
    override bool IsBuilding()
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    override bool IsWell()
    {
        return true;
    }
    
    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();
        
        AddAction(ActionWashHandsWellOne);
        AddAction(ActionDrinkWellContinuous);
    }
}`
So the set actions makes sense to me, not entirely sure about the is building/is well.
I have looked into some action files ie. minebush minetree etc some of which makes sense but alot refers to things I am yet to find.
I an not looking for an exact solution, rather if anyone could help point me in the right direction for further reading or a mod that does similar that I am
allowed to pick apart for research it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",,

144507985001971712,.theadmiral.,12/28/2021 2:53 AM,i would say look at the actions on knives and instead of adding the action at the vending machine add it to the crowbar,,

239057463146446848,¬Void#9487,01/04/2022 5:58 PM,My solution to the issue that not all buildings have ruin models is to spawn rubble like this but with the correct orientation,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,01/04/2022 5:59 PM,By correct orientation? Like the placement area?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/04/2022 6:00 PM,Could’ve an issue with the hiding of the map I key since that method sets its orientation and pos to vector.zero I think.,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,01/04/2022 6:00 PM,Get the building’s bounds or clipping info,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,01/04/2022 6:00 PM,That’ll give you a min max vector,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,01/04/2022 6:01 PM,Spawn your rubbbbbbbbble in that bound,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,01/04/2022 6:03 PM,"You shouldn’t need the building’s orientation to place rubble, just a defined area",,
239057463146446848,¬Void#9487,01/04/2022 6:06 PM,"Basically with that picture above it does the following

```
- Check the Object(building) in the vicinity
- Calculates the volume of the building by getting the CollisionBox
- Calculates the surface area that the building covers using the x & z of the buildings CollisionBox
- Spawns a pre-defined amount of ""rubble"" models according to these values to cover the surface area of the old building (inside a for loop)
```

Now, if I spawn 1 ""ruin"" model (1 object on its own) as the rubble and set the orientation by getting the orientation of the original building, it orientates perfectly fine

It's because its spawning multiple and setting the orientation accordingly to each individual rubble that spawns

and for some reason the surface area algo doesn't care about that data",,

(https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Samples/blob/master/Test_Crafting/Scripts/4_World/PluginRecipesManagerBase.c)

I tweaked it a bit (actually this is only thing in mod), but its not working on my side. Mod is loaded and cause no crashes on server or client.

Can someone confirm that next lines should work (maybe did something with recipes and touch that classes)? If it is, i will look for possible mistakes i made somewhere else in process.

modded class PluginRecipesManagerBase extends PluginBase
{
override void RegisterRecipies()
{
super.RegisterRecipies();
UnregisterRecipe(""CraftFenceKit"");
}
};

Thanks.",,

Working on a Crate that has sounds for opening and closing (like the barrel)
the barrel can also be digged.

385842099494453251,patvax,01/11/2022 12:06 AM,We are trying a similar approach to command a pack of zombies to move to a certain position using waypoints. We are using the AIWorld::CreateDefaultGroup method to create a group. Initialize every infected with the InitAIAgent method. Then we set for the entire group the waypoints that we try to calculate with the AIWorld FindPath method. From my understanding at this point the zombies should start moving through the waypoints. But in our tests they have the standard zombie behaviour of wondering aimlessly. Our goal is to tell a zombie pack to move to certaing location. Can this simply be achieved or do we need a cheat solution like playing a sound or something? Are we missing something?,,

does this remove the element from `arr2` too?",,
106922508707434496,thecrimsonzamboni,01/13/2022 2:41 PM,how did you declare `arr1` and `arr2`?,,
