185896664110727168,osodirty,09/05/2022 2:36 AM,I'd think it'd be a bit of config and script work.,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,09/05/2022 2:37 AM,So I would do config and make a HouseNoDestruct maybe and reference the car .p3d then in the script prevent them from getting in the car or something,,

here is an example i just shit out; hopefully it gives some sense on a use case for templates. 🙂

```cpp

//MUST use ""auto"" keyword, otherwise it will explode lol
auto myCfg = new ConfigLoader<SomeCfgType>(""$profile:someFile.json"");
Print(myCfg.Get().someData);
Print(myCfg.Get().moreData);
Print(myCfg.Get().yep);

/*
* Example use #2

//Example using Inheritance and further implementation of ""ConfigLoader"". Don't have to use ""auto"" here, because Enforce is magical and extremely consistent :)
MyExtendedCfgLoader mySuperCfg = new MyExtendedCfgLoader<SomeCfgType>(""$profile:someFile.json"");

239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/06/2022 2:46 PM,"Yea but that's restrictive. In this examples case, you DONT need to make an implementation everytime you have a new data type of config",,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/06/2022 2:48 PM,the example is basically `JsonFileLoader`,,

Searching here, I found this thread where Jason Mango attempts to help another coder address the same error. <https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/498756118906929162/517692523473403906>.  I gathered from reading this thread that the error is likely to be either (1) a path issue or (2) an issue with the layout file itself.  After struggling a while, I decided to download and build DaemonForge's EarPlugs example. <https://github.com/daemonforge/DayZ-EarPlugs> judging that both path and layout file should be set up correctly in the tutorial files.  I copied pasted the folder structure exactly except that I moved `config.cpp` inside the `earplugs\scripts` folder. <edit - __This was my original sin__ <https://discord.com/channels/452035973786632194/492295576470290433/1017842247447871649>>The mod  builds but I receive the same runtime error. The layout file loads in workbench.

So if a config.cpp is contained within a folder named ""Mymod"" it will produce a pbo with the name Mymod.pbo that contains the contents of that folder along with all of its subfolders. I copied the exact same  config.cpp that I had in my earplugs\scripts folder  into the earplugs\data folder, which resulted in a new pbo called data.pbo in addition to the scripts.pbo that was produced earlier.

    }
}``` But there is one little thing that tripped me up and might trip up a fellow noob. The code in `OnKeyPress` is called from the client. Therefore, `TestRPCFunction` runs on the server.

Player middle clicks on the map to generate a ping. Client communicates coords of the map ping to server using RPC. But I  want the server to broadcast the pings only to those players who have joined that particular map. I have an array for this purpose. Is there a way to do that or what is the best way?,,
