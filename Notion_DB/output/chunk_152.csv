295935955850887168,onemantooo,05/06/2023 9:28 AM,"Hello, guys, how can i add custom PlayerStat? 
I've extended `EPlayerStats_current` to add my stat, and modded `PlayerStatsPCO_current` to register it. 
Also i've created a field in `PlayerBase`, and a function `GetStatMyCustomStat` which sets that field.

But what bothers me is that there is no calls for `GetStatMyCustomStat`, although, for example, there is no calls for `GetStatStamina` either. 

Unfortunately, i can't check with a server by now, but anyway i have no ideas if i should add anything else.

My goal is to create custom stat, which will be saved between player sessions(reconnects), do i need any additional actions to save it between user sessions and sync with a server?",,
295935955850887168,onemantooo,05/06/2023 9:35 AM,Should i also mod `PluginDeveloperSync.SendRPCLevels`?,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,05/06/2023 9:47 AM,You could just load/save to a set of Json arrays on connect/reconnect/disconnect and whenever you use it..,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,05/06/2023 9:48 AM,0% chance of accidental playerdata corruption then.,,
295935955850887168,onemantooo,05/06/2023 9:56 AM,Why should it be corrupted? By some bohemia updates or what?,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,05/06/2023 9:57 AM,Or a mistake if you need to change something..,,
295935955850887168,onemantooo,05/06/2023 9:59 AM,"Isn't that worse by performance? This stat could be changed too often and on many players. 
Also as i understand this solution requires additional RPC calls?",,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,05/06/2023 10:01 AM,Completely depends on how you're using it..,,
295935955850887168,onemantooo,05/06/2023 10:08 AM,"Ok, i'm implementing player's sanity. So there could be AI, and Areas and also potentially other players who affects each other sanity. So i need server side implementation, and looks like i need to update it in JSON on each value change - that's why i don't like json solution.

What do you think is the likelihood of playerdata corruption? (If my code is well tested, and cannot corrupt it by itself) Did it happened before?",,

I need advice on ""how to"" or best practice's  for gathering Zombie and Animal kills.

Ive tried to use:
```C++

    void OnEntityKilled( Object killer, EntityAI target )
        {
            EntityAI killer_entity = EntityAI.Cast( killer );

                if ( killer_survivor )
                {
                    if ( target.IsPlayer() ) {
                        Print(""Player killed"");
                    } else if ( target.IsZombie() ) {
                        Print(""Infected killed"");
                    } else if ( target.IsAnimal() && GetGame().IsServer() ){
                    // Animal kills: not ALL animal kills are register....
                    // Why?
                    Print(""Animal killed"" + target);
                }
            }
        }
}
```
but the problem is that no all animal kills are registered.

I could pin it down to `ProjectionBasedOnParent` in hologram script.

```c

I'm new to dayz scripting, and I'm looking for documentation to build map events and modding stuff. I was able to make my first mod using the `Modding_Basics` and `Workbench Script Debugging` , but I don't know where to find official documentation to create my own mod after the tutorials. 

the only online documentation I've found was this one: https://dayzexplorer.zeroy.com/, but wanted to know if this is the one everyone is using or where should I go to learn more. thank you so much! üôè",,
