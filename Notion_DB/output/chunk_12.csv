188269899901042699,namco-4#8876,11/23/2018 9:29 PM,Update: It seems that constants which are defined as a sum of a variable and literal get evaluated as 0 when being accessed by primitive operators. (I wish i was making this up) Replacing the offset with a function that returns the offset or adding the offset via wrapper function avoids this.,,

Basically i've created a mod that allows you to move whilst you're in the inventory. But doing that has basically made it so the inventory doesn't register that it's open. So by pressing tab makes the inventory re-open literally instantly and by pressing esc to leave it, it takes you to the pause screen here's a video - https://youtu.be/1fLrR4jgUjM (ignore the lag, etc. I haven't messed with the settings of OBS at all. Literally just upped the quality in the settings. Will configure it more, later) But in that video you can see when i'm in the inventory and the cursor flickers, i'm pressing tab it does nothing. But when you see me go back to the pause screen, i'm pressing esc (currently the only way to close the inventory)",,ü§ò (1)

120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:03 AM,I mean PlayerIdentity only works from server perspective,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:04 AM,so how would you get the players name via client,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:04 AM,Ok I know this sounds stupid but how can I get/read Variables stored in the ServerMission from the server-side DayZPlayerImplement Class?,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:04 AM,"I don't think you can Kennedy, at least I haven't figured it out yet",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:05 AM,`CustomMission.Cast(GetGame().GetMission()).myVariable`?,,

120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:06 AM,Well whatever your mission class is called,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:06 AM,Ah damn so by that logic you can NOT  get any variables for the player for a client monitor?,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:06 AM,you can only put up text basically,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:07 AM,there is no player at MissionServer,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,how to request vars from server?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,you can only send vars via RPC,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,then recieve,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,so there is no way i could receive a players name via RPC,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,But you cant request them,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:08 AM,im really confused on this one,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:09 AM,what are you trying to do?,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:09 AM,I have a textwidget on my screen and im trying to get it to dispkay the players name,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:10 AM,character name,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:10 AM,"health_widget.SetText(""Name:"" + player.GetDisplayName());",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:11 AM,"`PlayerBase player = GetGame().GetPlayer();
string playerName = player.GetIdentity().someFunctionthatGetsTheName()`",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:11 AM,That returns an empty string on client,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:11 AM,hmm then when the server spawns your player could send an RPC from Server to client with the playerName in it.,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:12 AM,ü§î I can see that,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:12 AM,could you show an example how i could do that?,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:12 AM,im new to the dayz platform,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:12 AM,not programming,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:12 AM,then you should get yourself into RPC Calls first ^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:13 AM,search all the scripts in scripts.pbo for the keyword RPC and have a long read üòÑ,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:13 AM,you also need to make a own Enum for the calls,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:14 AM,so this is similiar to how you'd make calls for a form in visual studio?,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:14 AM,like the actions,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:14 AM,via enums,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:15 AM,"basical the server calls a method that has the params/vars in it, also to which player the rpc should get and an Enum/int value which call gets executed. Then your player has a Method that gets called on every rpc and in it it identifies which rpc call it is via the Enum/Int",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:15 AM,then the player reads the params/values,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:16 AM,hard to explain in a few sentences,,
