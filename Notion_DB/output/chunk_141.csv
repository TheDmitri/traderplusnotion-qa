600793545594634241,kpro1982,01/16/2023 9:51 PM,"I find this issue challenging. I think your approach to the problem is too theoretical.  In most cases, if you care at all, you want to __require__  code to run on a particular machine. This is done with a `if(GetGame().IsDedicated())` check in your code or an `#ifdef` block.  If you are curious where code is running you can find that out easily using WB.  WB will not hit breakpoints in code that runs on the server if it is in ""debug client"" mode and visa versa. The same is true for Print().  If you put a print inside an  `if(GetGame().IsDedicated())` block, that Print will only show up in the WB console if you are debuging in server and visa versa. If you want to know why code is running on one machine or the other, you can stack trace it back.  It will always be the case that code that runs on the server was called from the server and visa versa -- because you know they are different machines often in different locations. RPCs are the exception (and I think the only exception?) where you can call code on the other machine.  But the vanilla game has its own internal mechanism for keeping synch between server and clients. I think most of the time, we piggy back off of  that. If you want to force code to run on a specific machine e.g. the server.  Then you call it on that machine by hooking into a class like `MissionServer` that runs on server only. Or if you want to ensure that it runs on the client you can call it from `MissionGameplay` that runs only on the client. If you want the code to run on both, you can call in from `MissionBase` which runs on both. I recently found this documentation for CF which identifies a bunch of classes and states where they run.  <https://github.com/Arkensor/DayZ-CommunityFramework/blob/production/docs/Modules/index.md> CF is amazing and all its contributors are F*ing heroes! As I said, I still find this issue very challenging. If I've mistated anything, I hope those here that know better will correct me so that I'll learn something new. üôÇ",,‚ù§Ô∏è (1)

272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:27 AM,What's wrong with it?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:28 AM,ah i see,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:28 AM,That afaik only works for fire geo lods and geo lods,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:29 AM,For actual mesh it won't work bc then you allow for people to rip p3ds,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:30 AM,yes.. i know.. im in geo lod.. its wonky to say the least.. ive forgotten my original reason.. and am now gather as much info about it as i can to find the reasoning behind it..,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:30 AM,wanna hear what im doing?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:30 AM,Yeah because I used it without any problem before when dealing with some dayz editor stuff for TB,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:31 AM,So you might just be handling the data wrong or expecting something different,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:31 AM,yes correct.. im trying to understand what its returning.. more over.. hold on..,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:33 AM,im trying to get as much info about the proxy selection in the geo lod.. thats the simple answer,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:34 AM,What are you expecting to get with GetVertexPosition?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:35 AM,You use that to get a specific position of some specific vertex (The index you pass on is the id/index of the vertex in the mesh),,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:35 AM,some sort of pos of one of the vertex in the proxy selection.. so maybe i am using the wrong index.. perhaps..,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:36 AM,You are most likely using the wrong vertex index,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:36 AM,just know,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:36 AM,the position is in local space,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:36 AM,"here is some of the data im gathering.. in this, there is only one vending machine in the rail station.. but the model has two proxy selections for it.",,

272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:39 AM,then you have to transform the vertex position with the proxy world transform,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:40 AM,if you did it with the entity that has the proxy only then that will give you incorrect results,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:41 AM,im using the rail station as my parent entity... trying to get the pos (world or releative offset) of the proxy selection.. its IMPERATIVE i start with the selection in geo lod that is the proxy path.. if that makes sense..,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:42 AM,so i may be using the wrong index as this is all inside the first lcl of for loop of the selections of the parent entity..,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:42 AM,vector selectionPOS = geoLod.GetVertexPosition(i);,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:42 AM,that does not take the selection idx,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:42 AM,it's vertex id,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:43 AM,so it will always be wrong,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:43 AM,thats what i was working towards.. as being the culprit..,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:43 AM,yeah that IS the culprit,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:43 AM,how would i get the vertex ID of the 3 vertexs in the proxy selection?,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:45 AM,what do you mean loop thru it.. it?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:45 AM,If you separate the vertex in OB with a selection,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:45 AM,and the selection only has that vertex,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:45 AM,then just feed the index param 0,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:46 AM,"A selection contains 0, 1 or more vertices",,

272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:46 AM,or you can just make a selection of a single vertex in the p3d,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:47 AM,and just use the index 0 in the method,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:47 AM,and you get the position of that single vertex because there is only one if you did that,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/20/2023 5:47 AM,im doing all of this on vanilla p3ds..,,

272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:48 AM,If you want to get the position of selection with this,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:48 AM,then unless the selection contains only one point then it won't work,,
272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:48 AM,or you could do some math that will be expensive tbh,,

272245679013888011,marioe,01/20/2023 5:49 AM,then you might get away with just giving it 0,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,01/20/2023 4:46 PM,"Below you will see a stripped version of `VirtualHud`. In the constructor it is registering the badge/notifier display values so when the server serializes the values from the server to client it is able to mask the values into currently 2 integer numbers; the data is sent via RPC and the client deserializes the values to populate the HUD widgets (food/water/temp).

From my understanding, the serializer is appending ""full"" int masks into an array which should handle any overflow and scale the mask to the number of ints needed.

What I find is if I register a new element, increase the constant responsible for total elements my HUD properties become obviously out of order (full hunger always being 0, temp fluctuating up and down wildly)

The question here is, are my assumptions wrong? Is there something outside of VirtualHud that used to sync PlayerStat badges/notifiers

600793545594634241,kpro1982,01/21/2023 8:33 AM,"I'm having a rpc issues using CF's RPC.  The client crashes the __second__ time that it calls `SendRPC`.  I can debug until it gets to the RPC call from within SendRPC. ```GetGame().RPC( sendToTarget, FRAMEWORK_RPC_ID, sendData, guaranteed, sendToIdentity );```It crashes __after__ this call and the server __never__ receives the RPC.  Again the first time through it works as expected.  jThe following is the  CF SendRPC method which contains the last instruction before the crash:```void SendRPC( string modName, string funcName, ref Param params = NULL, bool guaranteed = false, ref PlayerIdentity sendToIdentity = NULL, ref Object sendToTarget = NULL )

        sendData.Insert( params );

There is no crash when it passes through the first time because its array member ```ref array<ref KPPlayerData> m_players;```is empty.  However, one the second pass, the array is given a single element.  Then it crashes the RPC call above. I'm struggling with why an array with elements would cause a crash. I send arrays with elements via RPC all the time. The only thing that I can think of is that RPC does not like nested arrays. -- in this case it goes three levels an array of elements that contains an array of elements that contains an array of elements.",,

Vanilla usually does send a specific id at first and the manually reconstructs the object from its properties depending on the typ that has been. Send. Check the serialization and such for inventorylocations (writetocontext / readfromcontext),,
