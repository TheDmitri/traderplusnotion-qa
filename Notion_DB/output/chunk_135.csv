585892620706775079,boomlay,11/08/2022 6:34 PM,"more like... for example... if you take the ActionOpenBarrel... the ActionCondition Function will be called with the barrel as parameter ""target"" in form of ActionTarget. So if you want to check if the barrel is open or closed, you'll need to call the Function IsOpen(), but this function is only available in the Class Barrel_ColorBase and not in ActionTarget. To Use this function you need to downcast it in it's inheritance strand to Barrel_ColorBase. If you already have a Barrel_ColorBase and you want to acces a function from Itembase (which is higher in inheritence) you don't need to cast... only if you need to go downn in inheritence.

585892620706775079,boomlay,11/08/2022 11:14 PM,"I am pretty sure, that your item inherits from ItemBase. So if you want to use something from ItemBase, there is no need to cast it.

But with many functions, the item is passed as EntityAI, for example.
If you need a specific function, that doesn't exist in EntityAI, you need to downcast the item.

Here is a little example from my fridge.
When you put food in the fridge's inventory, the decaytimer will be multiplied by a factor.

The item, that enters the inventory will be passed to the function as EntityAI. Food inherits from EntityAI... later from ItemBase and finally from EdibleBase.

But the decaytimer is a EdibleBase thing. It doesn't exist in ItemBase or EntityAI.

So I need to Downcast the item to EdibleBase before I can call the required functions. (like GetDecayTimer() or SetDecayTimer()

```override void EECargoIn(EntityAI item)
    {        
        super.EECargoIn( item );

        Edible_Base Food = Edible_Base.Cast( item );

        if ( Food && !Food.IsInFridge() )
        {
            float old_decay_timer = Food.GetDecayTimer();
            float new_decay_timer;
            int factor = GetBLPalletConfig().FridgeDecayFactor;

            if ( factor > 0)
            {
                new_decay_timer = old_decay_timer * factor;
            }
            else
            {
                new_decay_timer = old_decay_timer;
            }
            
            Food.SetDecayTimer( new_decay_timer );
            Food.SetInFridge( true );

i am really struggeling with one big annoying issue in one of my mods.

i made an immersive NVG mod with few new NVG-Devices, each of them with different colors, overlays and viewquality.

everything works pretty well, but one gamebraking issue is annoying me now for month and i have no idea why this is happening.

My Problem is, if i attach my NVG's to Headstrap or Helmet, activate NV and take of headstrap/helmet, i still have NV.

i really need some help, i need someone with knowhow to show me the issue, to help me to fix it.
i would pay for the help, but please HELP me.

Just brainstorming here:

Could I create an event handler so when a player connects it will add a record to DB with their steamID in it. Once that has been done I would **SetProfileString** to append the GUID or even just the SteamID itself to the players var file?

The plan would be that if a cheater or banned would connect again it will first check the vars file using **GetProfileString **and verify that the same GUID you set before is one associated if the match return **false**. 

I know it's something that is implemented in Arma3 just wanted to see if someone here would give me a Yay/Nay if it's something that would work with Dayz?

My POV is that most players when they change accounts don't delete the profile.var prior to re-joining again. Thanks!",,

708201682084823071,djhelix,11/18/2022 1:09 AM,fun fact. It seems the collision box visibly drawn at least doesn't seem to stay aligned with the vehicle when turning it stays at a certain angle and doesn't stay aligned with the vehicle. Is that done on purpose or is it a fault with my code some how or is it due to camera angle with drawing it this way? It's my last question regarding this mod. Just peeked my interest is all after seeing it.,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/18/2022 1:15 AM,you need to redraw every frame,,
708201682084823071,djhelix,11/18/2022 1:18 AM,Right now within MissionGameplay it's being drawn via OnUpdate is that not on frame? Can I use EOnFrame in MissionGameplay?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/18/2022 1:21 AM,why do it from mission gameplay when you can do it on the car itself?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/18/2022 1:23 AM,"override carscript and handle your debug shapes there. like checking if the engine is on every frame so that you can easily control when to show the shapes, and not apply it via action",,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:24 AM,"currently my output from my array is always 295, what am i doing wrong?
```bool arraysetup = false;
int numzed = 0;
ref array<ref int>zones;

void ZombieZonesArray(int location, bool killed)
{
    if(arraysetup == false)
    {
        zones = new array <ref int>;
        for (int i = 0; i < 400; i++)
        {
            zones.Get(i) = 100;
        }
        arraysetup = true;
    }
    if(killed == false)
    {
        numzed = zones.Get(location);
        //output message ingame
        GlobalNotification(""Radio report in sector "" + location, ""Zombies remaining "" + numzed);
    }
    else if (killed == true)
    {
        numzed = zones[location];
        zones[location] = numzed - 1;    
        //output message ingame
        GlobalNotification(""death"" , ""Zombies "" + zones.Get(location));//this should show 100 - 1 for every zombie killed in the area
    }
}```
also the location is returning correctly so i know ive got the right sector",,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,11/18/2022 1:45 AM,"I'm not tracking when you write ""output"" because the code that you have here does not have a print (which prints output to the output window) and is a void so it does not return a value.  Maybe put up the entire class.",,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,11/18/2022 1:46 AM,But your array is looking better since this morning so good work there. 👏,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:46 AM,GlobalNotification outputs into a notification in game,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:46 AM,its a seperate function,,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,11/18/2022 1:46 AM,As no one here reads minds we'd need to see that...,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:46 AM,yea sorry,,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,11/18/2022 1:47 AM,No worries 🙂,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:47 AM,the location is showing correctly as i move around the map but the zones[location] is always 295,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:51 AM,"also it isnt currently in a class, is that maybe the problem?",,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 1:56 AM,"added in the ref line as you suggested earlier
 ```   ref array<ref int>zones;```
now i'm getting 0 always, not sure if that is better or worse",,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,11/18/2022 2:04 AM,only add ref outside of your method.,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 2:04 AM,so move the ref above the function?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,11/18/2022 2:05 AM,yes.,,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 2:05 AM,"changed it above, like that?",,
270086659503030272,pumpkin_,11/18/2022 2:08 AM,"wont compile, multiple declorations of zones",,
