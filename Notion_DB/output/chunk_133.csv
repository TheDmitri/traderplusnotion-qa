However, you need to override this function by basically copying the whole function in your modded class hologram, as an override and then comment this few lines out.

But I highly recommend to add a check if the Kit/Item is really your item and if not, call super. 

In my ""Things"" Mod I added a bool to the config, so the admin can decide if he wants to use this fix only for my items or for every item.

So at the beginning of the function I have added this:

```override protected vector GetProjectionEntityPosition( PlayerBase player )
    {

        // The change only takes effect, if it is an item of my Mod or if the Admin allows it for all items per config File

        if ( !IsBLThingsItem() && !GetBLPalletConfig().AllowHologramFixForAll )
        {
            return super.GetProjectionEntityPosition( player );
        }

`class your_custom_base_class: DeployableContainer_Base {};`

and all your placeable items inherit from `your_custom_base_class`

Then you can check:
```override protected vector GetProjectionEntityPosition( PlayerBase player )
    {

        if ( !m_Parent.IsInherited( your_custom_base_class ) )

I'm not that good at scripting, so the idea is to use ""folding/unfolding iron sight"" script. But the trick is in changing ""EEItemAttached"" part (which stands for scope attached/detouched) for firemode state (semi or fullauto). I've found in vanilla scripts part that responsible for adding sound when switching firemode. But I don't know is the ""void OnFireModeChange"" right one. So this the original ""folding/unfolding iron sight"" script: ```override void EEItemAttached(EntityAI item, string slot_name)
    {    
        super.EEItemAttached(item,slot_name);

        if (ItemOptics.Cast(item))

Trying to make a script or config that prevents certain class names from saving so they are gone after server restart

I.E I want to force a select few gun, bag, storage crafting material, vehicle etc to not save to the economy, and respawn at another possible spawn point based on the nominal number in types.xml when the server is restarted.

Such as KOTH chests. If they aren't emptied, they don't despawn until they are flagged for clean up (after lifetime expires in types.xml) and can persist for hours. I also have a custom event that spawns stashes when the server is started that I want to not save so they are non-existant on the next startup

Trying to make it server side if possible. If not it will go in server mod

89025448524132352,hawkite,10/28/2022 3:34 PM,"Inheriting from the base class is definitely better. Just to make sure you gotta do the following:

**config.cpp**

```c
class YourRifle_Base: Rifle_Base
{
    scope = 0;
    // In here override any properties you wanna change, sounds like you did this already
};
class YourRifle: YourRifle_Base
{
    scope = 2;
};
```
Don't necessarily need a base class and then main one but I think it's good practice, makes it cleaner when doing retextures too

**scripts 4_World**

Hand placement + animations etc.

```c
modded class ModItemRegisterCallbacks
{
    override void RegisterFireArms(DayZPlayerType pType, DayzPlayerItemBehaviorCfg pBehavior)
    {
        super.RegisterFireArms( pType, pBehavior ); // Calling super here important to not break like every other gun
        pType.AddItemInHandsProfileIK(""YourRifle_Base"",                     ""dz/anims/workspaces/player/player_main/weapons/player_main_fnfal.asi"",         pBehavior,     ""dz/anims/anm/player/ik/weapons/fn_fal.anm"",         ""dz/anims/anm/player/reloads/fnfal/w_fnfal_states.anm"");
    } 
};
```

YourRifle.c

```c
class YourRifle_Base : RifleBoltLock_Base
{
    override RecoilBase SpawnRecoilObject()
    {
        return new FALRecoil(this); // Search scripts for different recoil patterns per gun etc.
    }
};

class YourRifle: YourRifle_Base {};
```

This file changes a decent amount per type of gun, this should work for a FAL style rifle. The `RifleBoltLock_Base` will change based on the weapon you are using the animations off of. For example FAL.c looks basically identical to what I posted above, so just copy the content of the weapon you are using. Bolt actions you will see have a lot more, most can be pasted in.

If you ever get weird animations or a gun not chambering a round after an empty reload it will almost always be you using the wrong weapon state _or_ you do not have the memory points properly defined within your P3D.

You can find the needed memory points with Eliteness etc.

I just wrote this so idk might have missed something, should get you in right direction. Lmk if you need anything else",,

It‚Äôs a bit hard to document every aspect of dayz, as the scripts are practically a majority of the game and it‚Äôs functionality. There‚Äôa commented documentation in a good bit of the low level stuff in the scripts, but you‚Äôre just going to have to unpack the game and use it as a reference for things you‚Äôre wanting to modify or add on to. You‚Äôre welcome to look at any mod on the workshop for flow, although everyone has their own understanding and may not always be correct. There‚Äôs a few mods extremely basic simples on BI‚Äôs GitHub and wiki as well. You‚Äôre mainly going to dive into a deep end and become overwhelmed initially while you grasp at understanding common vanilla systems you‚Äôll be interacting with or modding on top of.",,
