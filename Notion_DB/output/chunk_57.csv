214427063665295362,aeryes,05/27/2020 11:59 PM,Do you recall the callqueue function for making a function call a certain time later?,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:58 AM,Hey guys,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:59 AM,i was wondering if any of you can explain the difference between server sided and client sided mods?,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:59 AM,I'm looking to modify my cleaner to work server-sided which is using the class MissionGameplay.. but when i add it as a -server-mod it doesn't work,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:59 AM,it only works as a client sided mod that the player needs to download,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:59 AM,which isn't very good practice?,,
226234839924211712,JCurtis#5480,05/28/2020 12:59 AM,Any advice would be wonderful!,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 1:24 AM,missiongameplay is only client-side run,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 1:25 AM,so you need to execute it in missionserver if you want it just server side,,
245984266272505856,rualastor,05/28/2020 1:34 AM,How do I make Container_Base item immovable like a barrel?,,

225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,05/28/2020 1:51 AM,script file structure questions.. does the structure of the 4_World example play a part in the order scripts are compiled?,,
225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,05/28/2020 1:57 AM,is there ANY way to pass a ref array from one class to another?,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 1:57 AM,@Helkhiana  I notice after adding the line `if (!GetGame().IsServer()) return;` the config options are not used and it uses the hard coded default ones instead.,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 1:57 AM,For the client specifically.,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 1:58 AM,that's cause you're not getting the server rpc then,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 1:58 AM,check client logs,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 2:02 AM,It doesnt look like I am I guess,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 2:02 AM,I dont see anything in the logs,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 2:57 AM,@Helkhiana  is `CarLockPickConfig` your config json file?,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 2:58 AM,that one is just a name,,

214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 3:05 AM,but the client isnt getting the rpc,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 3:41 AM,@Helkhiana  i put a load of prints in and its not adding the server rpc. The void MissionServer print never prints to server logs. Also the clinet and server rpc funcs never get called,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 3:41 AM,All that gets called is void missiongameplay and OnInit() for missionserver,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 3:42 AM,Ive looked through letter for letter but cant see any mismatch or spelling errors,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 3:42 AM,show me your gameplay and server files,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,05/28/2020 3:42 AM,"Okay, ill pm you if thats okay",,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 3:48 AM,whats the first place that gets called when a character is created?,,
225304935355383808,[S.C.] Zedmag#7605,05/28/2020 4:30 AM,after creation ? or that calls the creation?,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 4:35 AM,i'm trying to trigger a UI first time player is created,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,05/28/2020 4:35 AM,You‚Äôre most likely going to have to store something in the files of the local client for ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù new players,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,05/28/2020 4:36 AM,It‚Äôs what I did for resurrection ages ago,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 4:36 AM,yeah,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,05/28/2020 4:36 AM,but before that,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,05/28/2020 4:39 AM,"I did probably a hacky solution, upon MissionStart in MissionGameplay, I‚Äôd call a looping call queue to a method, that would check if the player was actually an entity, and if it was it would prompt the UI and then remove the looping call from queue.

292426063999401986,a.l.i.x,05/28/2020 4:53 AM,Hello. How can I spawn buried LootChest at random positions (can be specified)?,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,05/28/2020 5:00 AM,"Another solution would be to use method `OnInit` in mission gameplay, opening the UI everytime, and when your server trigger `OnConnect`, you do a verification if client was already in server before, and if it was, it send automatically a RPC for forcing UI to close, that would be really fast, client would see the ui for only few milliseconds",,
