I don't know, whether that was reffering to me or not, but dude, no need to such agressively undermine my credibility. I run my own mod on Steam Workshop. I hate people, which repack mods and steal other stuff. I am a long-time BI games player and student of CSc., I'd rather prefer opening another mod and learning the process than using other people's content. Because a small community I mod for appreciates that from me. Yet, I was on vacation (and still am) and people contacted me with this error, which I did not know anything about, because I was not in touch with the update.

this is the code for rotating around zero:

vector axis = vector.Up;
float cosAngle = Math.Cos(m_time*5);
float sinAngle = Math.Sin(m_time*5);

SDebug.spawnDebugDot(result, 0.02, 5);

```c++
vector result = vector.RotateAroundPoint(vector.Zero,pos,axis,cosAngle,sinAngle);

it crashes",,

it shouldn't... lol

The weird thing is that it works perfectly if I implement it by myself doing like so:
```c++
vector offsetPos = pos - point;
vector result = vector.RotateAroundZero(offsetPos, axis, cosAngle, sinAngle) + pos;
```
which is the identical to vector.RotateAroundPoint.

- In which file and how do I change items spawning ""zones""? For example item kind 1 spawn in the zone kind 4
- How do I add automatic server restart after ""certain"" period of time? In which file or what's the command?
- How do I prevent items created with the map editor from duplicating itself and what's the command for that and in which file is it types xml or cfg or server.bat file.",,

You need to edit types.xml to modify in which zone an item spawns.
Automatic restarts is dependent on your hoster, or if you use dedicated server which i doubt you do

To prevent items from duplicating, you need to not spawn regular items like an m4a1. there's builderitems mod which helps you that gives a version that can't be moved and won't be duplicated e.g. bldr_m4a1",,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,09/20/2020 9:45 PM,it wasn't that vital to have it for my case tho,,

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 9:52 PM,My current code I am extremely worried will cause network lag,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 9:53 PM,How often can I send an RPC without having to worry about lag?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 9:53 PM,"as well, is it better to send multiple RPCs, one for each client, or to everyone, assuming the number of clients that I would be manually targetting would be a subset of everyone.",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 9:56 PM,"Here is some psuedocode of what I mean.

```
    void OnPlayerTick(PlayerBase player, float timeslice)
    {
        if(player)
        {
            if(player.UpdateHealthStats( player.GetHealth01("""", ""Health""), player.GetHealth01("""", ""Blood"") ))
            {

            }
        }
    }
```
Note that Player.UpdateHealthStats only returns true when the player's stats have changed since the previous tick.
Assuming the players that need to receive that RPC are only spectators, and that there really shouldn't be that many spectators, would it be efficient to iterate over spectators and send each one this RPC individually? 
Would sending this RPC on player update cause the network to lag when someone is regenerating HP or blood?",,

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:15 PM,Okay question 2,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:16 PM,m_Player.GetIdentity().GetPlainId(),,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:16 PM,that isn't available on the client,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:16 PM,are any unique Ids available to all clients?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:17 PM,that way I can match the payload data with PlayerBase objects,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/20/2020 10:17 PM,available only if the client is inside your network bubble,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/20/2020 10:17 PM,plainId is the steamID,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,09/20/2020 10:17 PM,so yeah unique id,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:18 PM,Okay so plainId is available for entities within the network bubble?,,

235718406492520448,niirozz,09/20/2020 10:18 PM,Yeah @Kegan,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/20/2020 10:18 PM,Steam ID isn’t available on clients,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:18 PM,GetId() is the hash,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:18 PM,PlainId is the raw SteamID64,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/20/2020 10:19 PM,It’s too sensitive for what ever reason,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,09/20/2020 10:19 PM,But plenty of games share it just fine,,

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:20 PM,the only way the player name appears is if the Identity is a valid object,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:20 PM,"so plainId, must not work.",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:23 PM,"Okay so my temporary solution, before I switch to big packets is to continue using OnPlayerTick",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,09/20/2020 10:23 PM,but delay individual player network syncs by 1000ms,,
