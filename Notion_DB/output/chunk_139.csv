600793545594634241,kpro1982,12/27/2022 7:43 PM,I have read through the ref wiki a few times but still struggle to understand __why__ the bad ref in the example is bad. It seems to me that in both cases the object lives to the end of the module? Can anyone who understand explain what is going on under the hood here?,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1057368189257924709/image.png,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 7:46 PM,`ref` is used to increase the reference counter for that object.,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 7:47 PM,"for example, this has a two counted references
`ref myClass myObj = new ref myClass();`",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 7:48 PM,"when myObj is deleted, the reference counter is decreased to one, instead of zero because of the `new ref`",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 7:49 PM,leaving `myObj` still referenced and not actually deleted,,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,12/27/2022 8:14 PM,Thanks.  Is it also true  that there is no way to fully delete myobj?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 8:15 PM,"if it's done like this, yes

600793545594634241,kpro1982,12/27/2022 8:23 PM,Thanks this is clarifying some issues for me.  Is it also true that myobj lives forever unless explicitly destroyed because it was defined outside of a class?,,
600793545594634241,kpro1982,12/27/2022 8:24 PM,Above i mean even in the good example above....,,
514742976463896578,golner,12/27/2022 8:44 PM,"hmm no luck till now :PES_BoiStop: tried with modded VPP Map class but no luck, please ping me when you know something @Wardog 🙂 many thanks for now and in advanced",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 8:47 PM,"yes, because `static ref` or `ref` in global scope, it'll live unless explicitly deleted",,

140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:26 PM,and not using diag,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:27 PM,"yes/no, i'm currently working on a private project that does just that. but it takes you building infrastructure around the idea",,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:27 PM,ok,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:34 PM,the rest is utilizing `ScriptModule#LoadScript` and `ScriptModule#Release`,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:35 PM,"i wrote this little write up ages ago, it's basic and explains the general gist of what you'd want to do

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:37 PM,you can use `ScriptModule#Release` to unload a script module you loaded with `ScriptModule#LoadScript`,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:38 PM,this will allow you to unload/reload a script module you've changed in runtime,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:39 PM,Ok this is very interesting,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:39 PM,I really appreciate your time on this,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:40 PM,`ScriptModule` also has `CallFunction` and `CallFunctionParams` in which you can dynamically call functions,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:40 PM,also look into `EnScript` to access class members variables that are protected/private,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:41 PM,what i'm writing allows me to dynamically update game modes globally and load user generated custom derived game modes,,

140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:42 PM,I can tell trust me,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:42 PM,it's good to know that you have that in mind,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:43 PM,such a quality of life that's needed,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:44 PM,only other project i know that utilizes a similar idea is eAI/Expansion AI,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:44 PM,in which that's a very weird mash for it's AI FSM,,

140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:45 PM,yes lol,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:45 PM,I keep digging more into Expansion AI since that's my main feature,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:45 PM,on that server I'm working on,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:45 PM,but i've never seen anyone else on this scale where you're using it to dynamically reload,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:47 PM,so as of now to edit server mod and test things out I have to repack and restart the server,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:47 PM,you still need to restart if you're just going to go with just that,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:48 PM,ok that's really good to know,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:48 PM,I just thought there is something else but we will adapt,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:49 PM,i use it on rearmed to patch server sided bugs that accidentally slipped through. so we don't have to push an update to the actual mod,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:50 PM,I'm definitely interested in that,,

server mod vs client mod  what's the difference and why can't we have all mods as server mods is it performance and storage limitation ?",,

561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:53 PM,some things require server and client side execution,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:53 PM,some things are just server only,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:53 PM,some things are client only,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,12/27/2022 9:54 PM,using hotpatches is __server only__,,
140574323160252417,dicey7,12/27/2022 9:54 PM,right,,

600793545594634241,kpro1982,12/28/2022 3:50 AM,"I have a data synching question. I have a UI that runs on the client.  However I save the data on the server. The client requests data from the server via RPC.  The  server opens the file, loads the data, and passes it back to the client via RPC.  However, sometimes there is a short delay between the client requesting the data and receiving it. If not handled, this would allow the user to modify data that would then be overwritten when the data from the server arrives. Is there an accepted pattern for handling this?  My current (probably very bad) idea is to use a calllater in a loop to wait until the client gets the data back.  Is there a better way to handle this situation?",,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/28/2022 5:10 AM,You mention `modify the data` at what level does this occur? Do you mean within your UI? Or is this a security concern outside of given user controls,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,12/28/2022 5:12 AM,You could set a flag to disable the UI or any other way to temporarily stop the user from modifying things until the reply RPC has been processed on the client,,

So I figured there should be no reason I can’t do some logic to figure out that capacity and then make it change my animation phase right? I was trying to do this… And I doing some thing ass backwards here? Or should this work? Because so far no luck. (Sorry for the lame code paste in a normal message.

There are two ways to get at the code from someone else's mod.  Many people, like me, put everything on git.  So if you find something on the workshop you can check to see if they list a git for it.  Otherwise, Mikero has a tool that will unpack a pbu to regular .c files.  Zed would what its called.  You can unpack to learn.

416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:19 AM,Year i get it a little better from Auto steamid i changed it to String Steamid the Print was Just for Test  so please ignore this Part and i dont know this was from a example which i found in the Internet 🙂,,
416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:19 AM,So i only changed the canreleasecargo function 🙂,,
416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:24 AM,But i wont Work :/ so at the Moment its the following scenario If the Player doesnt Match the Admin id you can Put Something in and cant move it in the chest anymore but of the Admin id Match the Steam id the Player can move it with left Mouse Button Holding but cant geht the Item Out of the Box Nor can he Change the Position of the Item and thats the Point i dont understand why cant the Player If He Match the Admin id Put the Item in His inventory or on the ground have you maybe a Idea on whats going on? ;/,,
416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:24 AM,Or what the Problem maybe is??,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:26 AM,What exactly do you want it to look like from players point of view… simplify it,,
416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:32 AM,I want to Player can Put the Item that he cannot Sale into a chest at the Trader and He and other Players unless the Player is a Admin shouldnt be able to Take a Item Out of the chest so that the Admin can Look into it and when he Put the Item in the config the Admin should be able to Take IT Out i Hope you can understand of what i want to do with it now 🙂,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:33 AM,why do you have open and close animations and crap in it?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:34 AM,like a you copied the barrel scripts.,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:34 AM,does it have animations of a lid that opens and closes?,,
416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:36 AM,Because the Main structure was a  example with all this ..... But dont sorry for that i change the whole Thing of i can get it to Work so that the chest doesnt have a Animation or be able to Lock Nor unlock the chest so First i want to try it with this example....,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:37 AM,what model are you using for your ‘chest’ ?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:37 AM,In object class?,,

416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:42 AM,Or let me ask it another way did i even Go the right path for my Script Idea ??,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/02/2023 1:43 AM,in config class. What is it inherited from…,,

416247565680508930,johnsengodwill,01/02/2023 1:54 AM,if the player placed the chest on the ground he have a option to open it then the animation is going that the chest get open and then you can see the inventory and can put stuff inside or pull something out but if you dont close the chest it stays open even after restart ^^,,

I know that you can extend a template if you use concrete types like this: ```class KPMap extends map<ref int, ref KPElement>```But in this case, the resulting class is not a template class. I want to do something like this:```class KPMap<class T, class T> extends map<class T, class T>```This would permit me to implement  KPMap with different types.```ref KPMap<int, KPFrame> framemap;
ref KPMap<int, KPDialog> dialogmap;``` I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. I searched the vanilla code for an example and couldn't find one which leads me to suspect this is not possible.  I would like to avoid having to upcast in the attached code at lines 90-91, which uses polymorphism instead of a template class as an alternative strategy. I will only keep one type at a time in the array so I will always know what the upcast should be. I'm sure this is shit but I'm trying to learn.",,

I've attached the entire short (I got it down to 46 lines) tester mod in case that helps.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1060026088891371520/image.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1060026089302409366/image.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1060026089621160056/RPCTester.c",
