does not give me inventory or option to attach sparkplug. so i dont think a generator will work this way lol.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1116514853968949248/image.png,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 1:54 AM,Did you create the scripted class and add the action to attach sparkplug?,,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 1:54 AM,"im less worried about the sparkplug attachment, as the inventory not showing up, even without the action, i should be able to drag one into it. let me check my script though.",,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 1:56 AM,Look at fireplaces/ovens maybe?,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 1:57 AM,They should have a clue as they're in houses and have inventory.,,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 1:57 AM,my script inherits power generator right now. but config has it as a housenodestruct which may be the problem.,,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 1:58 AM,its not technically inventory i guess. but it should show the attachments.,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 1:58 AM,"Well, yea a UI when in proximity that shows them",,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 2:00 AM,I really think fireplaces inside houses will have some answers. Maybe they're proxys.. then the proxy has the attachment abilities.?,,
185896664110727168,osodirty,06/09/2023 2:00 AM,Gotta be some trick to it.,,
414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 2:01 AM,fireplaces just have the action to attach a campfire. and the campfire proxy has its attachments i believe is how it works. unless its hidden in the BuildingWithFireplace stuff. and not the fireplace itself.,,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 2:04 AM,i'll look at that and see if i can figure something out.,,

414169679385460737,ctg_gaming,06/09/2023 2:39 AM,I guess an easier solution would just make it a normal object. Place it in my map to get coordinates. And then just have it spawn via script or something with storage category 10 so it just respawns on start,,

196845794513518592,shaggoth,06/09/2023 2:48 AM,so storage category thingie wasnt meant to be used that way?,,

Both `Init` and `OnTick` are called and modifier works fine with my custom injector

It gives `5%` of max health every `10.0` seconds while `quantity` is `> 0.0` (up to `+50%` of max health)
But seems like this modifier instance is persistent while player is alive and connected to server
So if player injects it one more time for  same character, its initial quantity will be `0.0`

I've created a custom suppressor attachment for my c14 timberwolf rifle.

 I need some help with the implementation of the idea, please or advice.
I made a laboratory centrifuge (model bought from sketchfab). Test tubes with different liquids are attached to it (as a proxy). The centrifuge can be connected to power generator or car battery as well, and after that the rotor can be started by pressing a button.
Everything works perfectly, the rotor is spinning, the lights are on when needed, **except for the main idea**.

Test tubes should change to other items (using a lambda, for example), but this does not happen. Btw, with lambda I can only change the centrifuge itself for any item, but not the attached items... 

Also, I can change the type of liquid or quantity in the tubes, but I don't want to create a new type of LIQUID to not cause conflicts with other mods and potential updates from Bohemia.

Maybe there is some **special, magical wizardous magic lambda** that can change the proxy **on** the object?
I wanted to release this mod in workshop, but without changing the object, the centrifuge is useless. I really hope for help, sorry for the terrible English. :why:",,

I use the command:
`Edible_Base food = Edible_Base.Cast(ingredients);`
`food.ChangeFoodStage( FoodStageType.RAW );`
The state changes to RAW for 20 seconds, then returns to the ROTTEN state again.
How to fix this state of food, as I understand it, there is a certain timer for food that also needs to be reset. Tell me how?",,

I use the command:
