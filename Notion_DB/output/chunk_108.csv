150883360019972096,hunterzcz,12/17/2021 9:31 AM,I think is possible make some triggers,,

708201682084823071,djhelix,12/17/2021 9:34 AM,So curious if it's logical to prevent a car wipe to do kind of like the Garage mod does and save people's owned vehicles under a file in the profile's folder instead of using OnStore,,

402863665512054787,mynameisim,12/23/2021 2:53 PM,"Hello everyone.
I want to disable engine damage when EngineGetRPMMax is exceeded.
In the original script, this is located here:  scripts\4_World\Entities\Vehicles\CarScript.c

I try to just stop the engine instead of taking damage:
```
if ( EngineGetRPM() >= EngineGetRPMRedline() )
{
  if ( EngineGetRPM() > EngineGetRPMRedline() + 800)
    EngineStop();
  ProcessDirectDamage( DT_CUSTOM, null, ""Engine"", ""EnviroDmg"", ""0 0 0"", 0 );
}
```

But the problem arises in the case:
If I drive more than 110 km / h, and very quickly change into first gear while holding shift, the engine still burns out instantly. How can this be fixed?

I have made and registered the recipe, check the ingredients, `CanDo()` just returns `true` and `Do()` just does nothing as usual.
It seems that i cant even get the ""action"" of ""repair"" to show up ingame. I tried the same stuff with an already existing repairkit like `EpoxyPutty` and it just works.
The Bandage is registered as a repairkit in the config.cpp and i just gave it ID `9` (also tried different ID's, same result)
The Shovel also has `repairablewithkits` set to include ID 9

And yes this works for the standard repairkits that are already in game. But not for bandages. In our custom recipe we took out the ""PluginRepairing"" logic and just placed return true there. Since our recipe literally only accepts a shovel and bandage as the 2 ingredients returning true should be the right thing to do. This should be at least enough for the action to come up ingame.

The idea is when a player is holding a cursed weapon, a series of symptoms begin to run. Some is just laughing. Some is fever blur. Some is hearing zombie Argos, or wolf sounds; and even hearing local players talking. ALL only appear on the client holding a cursed weapon. Independent of any other players also holding their own cursed weapons. One of the curses would be randomly seeing a zombie agroed on them.. the zombie attaches them but disappears when it touches them. From player point of view they aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs real or not‚Ä¶ so they must make a choice to defend first or shoot first. Whilst OTHER players near them are wondering what the heck he‚Äôs doing. Lol",,üëå (2)
