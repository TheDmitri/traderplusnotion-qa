561680015578759196,wrdg,08/05/2019 11:48 PM,But I wanted to force players to check the pulse of players before they can resuscitate them,,

424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/06/2019 12:18 AM,Am I right in thinking the context in`OnStoreLoad` and `OnStoreSave` methods in `PlayerBase` are specific to the user?,,
424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/06/2019 12:20 AM,And is this the right approach to storing custom player data?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:25 AM,No and yes. OnStoreLoad is not only for player,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:25 AM,If you track where it‚Äôs defined it‚Äôs either EntityAI or ItemBase from what I recall,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:26 AM,So you can use it for any object that can be saved over in the db,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:26 AM,"It can hold int string Booleans as data, also Param-6 pretty sure",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:26 AM,And yes you can save your ‚Äúcustom data‚Äù by overriding it and calling super,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:27 AM,I would say this is one of the only methods to save custom data for your player,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:27 AM,As it‚Äôs using the proper DB and it‚Äôs pretty simple to use,,
424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/06/2019 12:27 AM,What I mean is will the data be loaded/saved be user specific,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:27 AM,Yes,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,08/06/2019 12:28 AM,"If it‚Äôs PlayerBase, pretty sure",,

Is this a limitation of the engine:
```
        if(g_Game.IsServer()) {
            EntityAI obj = g_Game.CreateObject(""Flashlight"", GetPosition());
            Print(""Server created: "" + obj.ToString());
        } else {
            EntityAI obj = g_Game.CreateObject(""Flashlight"", GetWorldPosition());
            Print(""Client created: "" + obj.ToString());
        }
```
It's only test code but that gives me a compile error saying obj is declared twice. I guess these blocks do not have their own scope?",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,08/09/2019 10:05 PM,you can't forget about the hierarchy if you're modding a class/method,,

424303763432669185,Dan-Diatonic#3752,08/09/2019 10:20 PM,Perhaps it's not a limitation as it means the client server must have the same state(ish),,
