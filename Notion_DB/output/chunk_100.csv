239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:08 PM,Add an offset?,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:16 PM,Yes.,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:16 PM,"I tried 
```c
vector ray_start =  GetGame().GetCurrentCameraPosition() + GetGame().GetCurrentCameraDirection() * 4;
```
But still no luck.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:16 PM,"Also, how come you cant / don't want to ignore player object?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:16 PM,There could be another way to do it,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:17 PM,"Well, I'm raycasting to find PlayerBase.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:20 PM,🤔 have you tried passing the player within `Object with = NULL` param of the raycast?,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:21 PM,It is now,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:22 PM,"Oh. And look
```c
DayZPhysics.RaycastRV(ray_start, rayEnd, position, contact_dir, contact_component, hitObjects, null, player, false, false, ObjIntersectFire);
```",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:22 PM,it should ignore the player,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:22 PM,"So strange. But may be there is a way to offset into caera direction? 
vector ray_start =  GetGame().GetCurrentCameraPosition() + GetGame().GetCurrentCameraDirection() * 4;",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:23 PM,Did you check which object it collides with?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:23 PM,It could be hitting objects behind the camera,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:24 PM,"Your offset looks too high try with smaller value, `0.25`",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:24 PM,"Yes. When I cast it from my character cameraposition, it hits me.",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:24 PM,Hits that same character of mine.,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:25 PM,"Even with 4 it still collides with it. I enable free camera and move forward 1,5 meters and it stops colliding.",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:32 PM,"Look, here's how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5GSKAJg_mM
When you see character name, it means the ray hits some PlayerBase. It should start farther from the face and not hit the ""caster"".",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:35 PM,"You could try to change your starting pos to:
`MiscGameplayFunctions.GetHeadBonePos(notnull PlayerBase player, out vector pos);` and with the addition of a forward direction offset
just note that it won't work when in freecamera since the position is tied to player specifically",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:38 PM,"Thanks, I will try.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:39 PM,"You could also try something like this:
```csharp
vector GetHeadingPosition(PlayerBase player, float distance)
{
    //distance = how far away from origin postion (try 0.25 first and go up)
    float heading = MiscGameplayFunctions.GetHeadingAngle(player);
    vector posModifier = Vector(-(distance * Math.Sin(heading)), 0, distance * Math.Cos(heading));
    return posModifier + player.GetPosition(); //position returned will be where the player is facing
}
```",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:40 PM,You could replace heading angle calculation and `player.GetPosition();` relative to data from the camera,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:40 PM,if you don't wish to tie it only to player,,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:40 PM,"Oh, that looks nice! I'll try.",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:41 PM,"Also, if you are running a Diag setup exe, you should visualize these by drawing debug lines",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:41 PM,Saves you alot of time 😄,,
137994686852890624,jadfi,09/04/2021 3:41 PM,Take a look at `Rangefinder.DoMeasurement()`,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:42 PM,"This should work too, only issue is the ""nametag thing"" you have won't work on your OWN player",,
259167640377884673,dzr_mikhail,09/04/2021 3:43 PM,"And I wondered, why my debug spheres and lines are not working. I should have ran the DayZDiag_x64.exe?",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:43 PM,"I assume you do want it to work for your own player, otherwise just passing the player object in the ignore can work just fine btw",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:43 PM,it does not mean it will ignore all PlayerBase types or that type you pass,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,09/04/2021 3:43 PM,It ignores that 1 thing you pass,,

Trying to get vegetables to stack for a recipe.  AFAIK you can do this with Inventory_Base but I don't want to override Edible_Base and defunct the normal workings of the vegetable.  Tried adding this in a config but it just results in the vegetable being able to be split 10 times

536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:27 PM,Well because of how aiming works I can't always use selections or memory points for the calculations.,,

272245679013888011,marioe,09/11/2021 7:32 PM,the main issue here is the light limits,,

272245679013888011,marioe,09/11/2021 7:34 PM,The issue is for light entities being around in the view distance,,
536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:34 PM,and there's little chance there'll be 30 doods running around with lasers on the server i'm making this for lol,,

536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:36 PM,but you can still clearly see the target dot wandering,,
536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:36 PM,no such broblems with attached light,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,09/11/2021 7:36 PM,why don't you use a custom model of a cylinder with emissive material? 🙂,,

536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:37 PM,it would also likely be obnoxious visually,,
536921929932603412,xamy9000,09/11/2021 7:38 PM,I really just need these get these two end coords inside the laser attachment space properly and i'm set,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/11/2021 7:38 PM,btw there is a minimum radius and angle for light,,
272245679013888011,marioe,09/11/2021 7:38 PM,so you might have issues because of dispersion,,

`Do` is called after the result items are spawned, what you can do is get the ingredient of which is the one you're wanting to replace, and replace the result's position and orientation",,
