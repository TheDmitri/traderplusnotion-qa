185896664110727168,osodirty,04/26/2022 7:23 PM,Well you can definitely do it. You would need to find out the base classes for each type and add the action there. Then do cast checks to verify which you're looking at to check for certain attributes like unconsciousness on a player for the action condition,,

(I dont actually want ppl to be able to fill from the ocean but on the map im making for some lakes im using 'oceans')

in 'ActionFillBottleBase' for the method 'GetLiquidType' i changed:

CCTWaterSurface waterCheck = new CCTWaterSurface(UAMaxDistances.DEFAULT, UAWaterType.FRESH);
to -> CCTWaterSurface waterCheck = new CCTWaterSurface(UAMaxDistances.DEFAULT, UAWaterType.ALL);

this way its letting me fill up the bottle but im getting ""error"" in the bottle instead of water. For the continous bottle fill action it passes the result of 'GetLiquidType', which returns LIQUID_WATER. Is there some other check for the water type based on the surface/object somewhere?",,

I'm a rank amateur at this coding stuff (full self taught from tutorials from amazing folks in this community). 

I created a mask that will hold custom NVG modules in a special attachment slot so normal NVGs cannot be attached to it. I used NVG Strap as the base for the mask and NVG_Goggles for the base for the new NVG units.

When I attach the modules to the custom slot they appear correct on the player but will not activate when I press ""L"". Pretty much narrowed it down to the fact that I am not using the default NVG attachment slot as when I add that to the mask and place my module in there it works fine but my custom NVG unit does not show up on the player model.

Any thoughts?",,
