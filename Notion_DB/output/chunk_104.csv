There is some functionality that we would welcome in the game so I started looking into Dayz modding and the enforce scripting language. I noticed the proto and native keywords and began to wonder if it is possible to write code in another language (e.g. c++) and somehow call that code from enforce script. There are just things that I think are easier with more mature languages like json parsing which could be done with some sort of library.
So my ultimate question is: is it possible to call native code from enforce script without too much hassle. If not, what are the proto and native keywords for?",,

By default AddonBuilder puts temp folders in `%appdata%\Local\Temp`, but you can change it

@Lugge I don't know why and when it happens, but I had the same issue with pboProject when building certain mods, which by default puts temp folder in your P drive, causing this issue.

536921929932603412,xamy9000,11/14/2021 10:12 AM,you could even do a specific case to allow water to be collected while the player is holding it up in their hands P:,,

1) Canteen is Outside  (works )

3) Canteen is Inside Player `(bool dentro = fantozzi.GetHumanInventory().HasEntityInInventory(this);)` here i got a NULL POINTER ( but the `if` works except that the canteen is still fill inside the inventory player too :p ) so i tried a `If(!fantozzi) return;` before all the stuff and after the `PlayerBase fantozzi;` but in that case it runs always `return;` and never get inside the `check`

the ray cast can check the player only if is covering the Item not if the Item is inside i guee, right?
