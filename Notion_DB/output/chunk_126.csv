270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:18 PM,thank you so much. i'll take a look at it! I could not figure out where to even look for changing anything sound through scripts,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:19 PM,"My thought process was this, these sounds are controlled by animation events, so I searched for AnimSoundEvent and that led me there",,
270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:21 PM,that makes sense lol. i've only been working with dayz mods for a few months and for some reason I dislike cpp and wish to stay on script side for stuff,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:22 PM,CPP is the way to go for this though,,

272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:22 PM,script would make you more problems and most likely mess with other people's creatures if you are not careful,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:23 PM,@Comrade Sythar You do not have to copy a whole class to modify it in configs,,
270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:23 PM,really?,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:23 PM,Yeah,,
270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:24 PM,"I was under impression that unless you make a super call, which can't be done in cpp, you would overwrite the class with whatever you put in",,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:25 PM,"Let's say you have this in vanilla

  someArg1 = 0.0;
  someArg2 = 0.0;
  someArg3 = 0.0;
  someArg4 = 0.0;

then on your mod, if you want to change `someArg2` to `1.5` then you do this
```cpp
class SomeVanillaClass
{
  someArg2 = 1.5;
};
```",,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:25 PM,That will patch your change on top of the vanilla one,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:25 PM,just make sure you set the CfgPatches of the addon that contains that in vanilla or in a  mod as a required addon,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:26 PM,If it didn't work this way then every other mod would be resetting each other changes,,
270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:27 PM,so does it append existing arguements and add new code below if there is any?,,

270361126557057034,comradesythar,07/28/2022 12:28 PM,aaah! that makes sense new. Thank you! You actually answered a few questions I didnt know how to ask lol,,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 12:28 PM,if you use `+=` on an array then it appends it to the array,,

that is not fault of the feature, it's fault of the other modder that decided to replace the entire attribute either willingly or unwillingly by not knowing of `+=`",,
272245679013888011,marioe,07/28/2022 4:01 PM,same as in not calling super in scripts,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,07/28/2022 4:03 PM,Correct. Thus why I said true in theory. But right now like 2% of misers changed and fixed or added the += and I have noticed it doesn‚Äôt work at all if trying to do it in an array that‚Äôs nested inside another class inside a base class. Like attachments for doors of cars where there is also a GUI attachment class,,

This works great and all, but I can't help but focus on things I don't understand. Did I just miss a break point, and this is good programming - or is my math off and I need to solve that?

I want to fix a compatibility issue between** Namalsk Survival** mod and vanilla **Chernarus **map. Namalsk Survival mod is modding **ActionFillBottleBase **class to look for specific surface types that are only found in Namalsk Island. My objective is to run Namalsk Survival mod with my mod on top of it to correct the compatibility problem with Chernarus.

You can find attached my latest try which is still failing. I'm trying to bring back the vanilla logic in a new modded ActionFillBottleBase class that would replace Namalsk survival modded ActionFillBottleBase Class. Im pretty new and not sure I understand mod execution order correctly yet. If someone could give me a hint or point me in the right direction that would be very appreciated.

207902577713479680,simonvic,08/07/2022 10:45 PM,"guys what are the differences between getting Config values with `Object::ConfigGetFloat(path)`  and `CGame::ConfigGetFloat(path)`?

For example, with a config like this
```cpp
class CfgVehicle {
  class M4_OEBttstck: Inventory_Base {
    someValue = 69;
    class SomeNestedClass {
      someNestedValue = 420;
    }
  }
}
```

doing 
```csharp
GetGame().ConfigGetFloat(""cfgvehicle M4_OEBttstck someValue""); //returns 69. Correct
GetGame().ConfigGetFloat(""cfgvehicle M4_OEBttstck SomeNestedClass someNestedValue""); //returns 420. Correct
```
works fine. But if I do 
```csharp
m4Buttstock.ConfigGetFloat(""someValue""); // returns 69. Correct
m4Buttstock.ConfigGetFloat(""SomeNestedClass someNestedValue""); //can't find the value!
```",,

If there was a way to make the Trader mod moneyless, and make it purely credit. Maybe each trader has their own credit, but it's like instead of having rubles in your pocket and the trader saying ""you have this much money"" you sell stuff to the trader, and it says ""you have this much credit"". That way it's more like a barter system than money in an apocalypse, y'know?

1. I have some items that have a carry animation like the metal plate. Some work well, some don't - they hold correctly in my hand but as soon as I move they behave like Autocenter 1...but it's not. I can also sprint with the faulty items in hand, although I should only be able to walk.
The Items are split to multiple pbo's, each pbo has it's own modded playercfgbase class.

2. The above items are kits for a furniture mod I've been working on for quite a while. So far I haven't had any problems with placing objects, but now I've found that a certain kit crashes the server when I place it. At least on my online test server... but if I test the mod on a local server with no other mods, everything works. So I suspect that it is due to an incompatibility with another mod. Crashlog, Scriptlog and DayZServer.rpt log don't give me any meaningful information.
Also, it's odd that the faulty kit works exactly the same as all the others. The only functions I override from my kit base class are to return simple information like the name of the item to place. I don't really know where to start to troubleshoot the problem because I simply lack information or experience.",,

The only way currently to get ModStorage support is to require Expansion-Core since ModStorage isn't enabled in CF. Then all you have to do is wrap them in `#ifdef EXPANSION_MODSTORAGE` .. `#endif`
Yes this will continue working if/when ModStorage ever gets enabled in CF, but at some point after that it would probably be a good idea to just swap that out with `#ifdef CF_MODSTORAGE` instead (or remove the ifdef wrapper entirely), so plan for that.
