that works all as it should
a player can dissmantle the build up Bench with a tool aswell, then it turns into a box again.
the one thing that doesnt work, is that when a player has placed down the box so it becomes a kit, i want the player to pack the kit again to a box, without tools.
i want to do it like this, so that when players find a box. often they place it down randomly... and the workbench has a very long lifetime, which clutters up the world for no reason. so i want the kit as a step that requires a tool with a shorter lifetime, so that there arent random workbenches on the coast as much",,

I decided to delete the scripts i made and go from square 1 because at least i could load my modded items into the game to test them. Well now, after deleting DayZ server and re setting up everthing. Im trying to load my mod into the game and its saying that i have a pbo which is not part of the server. I made sure my mod was listed properly in the batch file, i made sure my pbo's were crunching into the correct location and that i have the correct local mod loaded into the launcher but its still giving me a pbo error. i can not make sense of this and im ready to give up... please help!",,

Nothing more.
IDK why, but(!) some object types return an empty string when you are calling GetType() on the target object on the server side.
and some types behave the same way even on the client side!

So I found solution which works for all types that are interested for me, I decided to use p3d filepath as location and container identifier and obtain that on client side via ""GetShapeName"".

Both Location and Container initially had to be just class names, like identifiers. Some identifiers had to be real class names, some - kinda virtual areas (like Circle250m with the center at LocationPosition) 

But anyway, I cannot use just short p3d file name as type identifier, cause there are a few name collisions, so path suits better. 
also no one can guarantee, there would be no custom p3ds with same names, like woodenbox.p3d or something. Full path is unique and covers my needs, but I cannot pass this data cause of the ActionData limit mentioned above",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/1142458891347689472/image.png,

it wil work but... It sucks. 
anyway it will be more stable than class name, cause class name also can be too long to pass that via ActionReceiveData

so with that solution, ActionReceiveData size can be reduced to two ints and two vectors. But anyway I'd better extend ActionReceiveData capacity üôÇ",,

There is an addon (Proxy Search Framework) which has a file with a huge amount of class definitions (as a hack), just to push the game to recognize the type of object you are targeting at.

that was discussed above, in two words: yes, I can use inheritance, but that's not **easily ** maintainable and** it's a dirty hack **
also I already have a simpler and much extendable solution. **Which is also a hack.** That's why I am so sad.

So would be perfect if I could obtain the unique **int** value from any **visible item type** in the game. Not the item identifier, but item type identifier.

and this **int** has to be unique, the same way as a class name is unique. 
And both the client and server should know how to obtain **related type**  using this int value, **without any extras** like RPCs, mappings, inheritance **and other hacks which are out of action context**, may cause a race conditions or another issues.

**But how to get this unique int identifier for each visible item type in the game? **
**If you know how to get that - I'd really appreciate that, cause I cannot find anything.**

for now, I am aware of string.Hash() function. I can apply it on the string value (class name or p3d path) to obtain the int value, a hash of that string. hashes are pretty unique, but they have next drawbacks:

- hashes are not revertable, cause it's how math works. 
So  in that case I have to do a hack and create a reverse map to be able to convert int to string on the server side, to obtain a class name from the int 
That's what I am currently working on (almost done) but I dont like it
- hash sum collisions, which could be a potential issue for such a small hash container as int. Which may push me to use external hash sum calculators and much more hacks I dont want to play with.",,
519619804613705729,sr.pomidor,08/19/2023 8:15 PM,"Oh, I forgot to mention something.
**item type + item location = item identifier**
Yeap, that's a composite identity. 
All objects I am going to use as targets **are static**, so location is 'immutable' and is unique for each item.

the next idea I was thinking about - build a list of vectors and use them as item identities, cause I may already know what is on that position

519619804613705729,sr.pomidor,08/19/2023 10:30 PM,"no worries
sth much more better than SearchForLoot 
- you can loot ground for small rocks, sticks or worms (if it's raining)
- loot trees (similar to tree shaking)
- loot static items similar to SearchForLoot, but in more realistic way: fridge has food and wardrobe has clothes
- loot mailboxes, toilets, piles of manure, piles of garbage
- loot some 'closed' items with tools (like static locked lockers)
- loot water for... IDK why, to catch a frog üòÑ why not?
- loot car wrecks for some parts,
- loot bushes for some bird eggs
- loot the ground around heli crash in some radius
  
actualy, loot everything you can see in the game. that's why it's all around p3d file names üòÑ

for now 
- I can ""loot the earth"" 
- loot static items similar to SearchForLoot, but all it has in common with that addon  - that's the player looting mechanics.

and server side spawn logic will be out of action ""OnServerFinish"" or whatever",,

I have 2 different bunker entrances and I want different configs for both of them. one can be standard (i¬¥ve only modified the sounds but besides that it can stay standard) and then 2nd one I want to change the script itself a bit.

so in a mod config cpp i triedt that:

class CfgVehicles
{
    class Land_Underground_Panel;
    
    class CustomPanel: Land_Underground_Panel
    {
        scope=1;
