Same with the class constructor.

You've also got a bunch of functions that you're *not* overriding and just tossing in as void/bool <blah> without the override keyword, which is bad news.

To troubleshoot this properly, you wanna check your crash\_ and script\_ logfiles. My guess is you've got a null pointer somewhere and a function required for the menu to work correctly is just crashing at that point and doing nothing else",,
