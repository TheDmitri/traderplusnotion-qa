105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:34 PM,the modding basics is great,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:34 PM,other then that there is nothing,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:35 PM,but honestly would be beter to first work out autocomplete for enforce 😛,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:37 PM,the workbench has autocomplete,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:38 PM,oh realy ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:38 PM,oh shit,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:39 PM,do they use a langue server behind the scenes ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:40 PM,"well gotta joink that one somehow, i am not a fan of their interface 😨",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:41 PM,https://gfycat.com/SneakyMealyBluebottlejellyfish,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:41 PM,you can edit the interface in the __W__indows option on the options bar,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:42 PM,"yeah i saw , i do have workbench open, just to see console",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:42 PM,its not just interface,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:42 PM,in vsc i can press ctrl p to search for a file,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:42 PM,"I got a good workflow with vsc, would like to stick with that one instead of a editor for a specific game",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:44 PM,i don't think workbench uses a language server,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:44 PM,it's all local,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:44 PM,yeah didn't think so,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,"workbench is also built in C++, unlike their other tools",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,ugh,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,hoped it was enforce tbh,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,their other tools are in C#,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,seems like a weird difference tbh,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:45 PM,so you can peer into the the interpreted compiled source with a tool such as dnSpy,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:46 PM,at that point its to much effort for me,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:47 PM,atleast for what i want to do,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:47 PM,"well maybe not , i would like to be able to compile from vsc aswell",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:47 PM,"idk not now for sure,maybe they release some nice tools to support different workflows",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:48 PM,"i've created my own workflow with powershell for compiling and launching offline mode, or server and client",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/05/2019 11:49 PM,i use pboProject,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:50 PM,"hmmm , maybe i should look into that.",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,11/05/2019 11:50 PM,thanks,,

107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/06/2019 1:03 AM,@TheDimin It should if you're trying to load it within the mission scope. You should be able to just paste the function for OnKeyPress within the same class in the example wardog gave and you would have both methods,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/06/2019 1:35 AM,You can call just about anything from mission going back to world and game.,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/06/2019 2:37 AM,No real hackers use sqf,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/06/2019 2:38 AM,That's a forbidden language.,,

561680015578759196,wrdg,11/06/2019 4:09 AM,You're better off creating your own locking mechanics,,

355565030437289994,zysen,11/06/2019 4:53 AM,oic,,
355565030437289994,zysen,11/06/2019 4:53 AM,you gave me this advice before and now i see where it really fits,,
355565030437289994,zysen,11/06/2019 4:55 AM,thanks again,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 8:47 AM,Anyone know if the server or client handles removing the seed once it's planted? Trying to fix the unlimited seed glitch if you water the patch first,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 8:48 AM,Or should I just require the player to plant first before watering,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 8:49 AM,the action happens on server from what i can see,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 8:50 AM,class ActionPlantSeed,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 8:52 AM,"```seed_IB.SplitIntoStackMax( garden_base, slot_ID, action_data.m_Player );``` it's what splits the stack from hand and puts it in slot",,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 8:53 AM,you could probably do a check for seed_IB quantity before and after and ensure you remove one,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 9:03 AM,"I fixed it. Just did this.
```
modded class Slot

137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 9:04 AM,i wouldn't have changed the behaviour,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 9:04 AM,confuses players,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 9:04 AM,I mean you shouldnt water ground before you plant a seed. Kinda logical,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/06/2019 9:57 AM,Here let me ask this,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 9:57 AM,It was working on offline mode but when I put it in my server it broke. One part of it where it auto pulls works but the water option is completely gone. Guess I'm gonna have to do what you said @Helkhiana,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,11/06/2019 9:57 AM,Do you water your toothbrush and put the toothpaste on and water that bitch again afterwards?,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 9:58 AM,@Wardog Lmao,,
288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 9:59 AM,I need to figure out how to verify the seed count before and after and I'm wayy too tired for that rn lol,,

288454483053117451,Nova#6953,11/06/2019 10:35 AM,ive always used lowercase first letters in java & c++,,

137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:15 AM,well there's the deploy time on ActionDeployObject,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:16 AM,DEFAULT_DEPLOY = 5,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:16 AM,is this related to your hardigg placement?,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:16 AM,i've noticed it takes quite a bit,,
402077901174079499,munghard,11/06/2019 11:27 AM,yes it is. doing some reconfiguration on it currently,,
402077901174079499,munghard,11/06/2019 11:28 AM,"i wonder how i could change that only on the hardigg, any ideas?",,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:29 AM,i remember seeing something like IsInstant somewhere but i need to look more for it,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/06/2019 11:29 AM,probably best to just make your own new action class,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:30 AM,having inheritance from barrel might have something to do with it too,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/06/2019 11:30 AM,you can inherit it from the devs class,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:31 AM,i don't have custom deploy action and does it pretty fast,,

402077901174079499,munghard,11/06/2019 11:32 AM,should atleast get the hologram material for it now.,,

402077901174079499,munghard,11/06/2019 11:39 AM,not sure why it takes so long to place even when inheriting off of barrel. barrel is insta place right?,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/06/2019 11:39 AM,"it should be default place, 5 seconds",,
402077901174079499,munghard,11/06/2019 11:40 AM,its def not 5 seconds on barrel,,

It could well be some kind of script definition like with the ctx.read/write stuff, but too me them disappearing on restart not DISCONNECTING is actually more so the lifetime values not being respected, check there's not a double entry of the types?

I'd suggest using a text editor like VSCode, Sublime, or Atom while you're scripting, the workbench isn't always reliable and sometimes crashes, leaving your unsaved work in the garbage. Most of your learning is going to be coming from the unpacked game data, which some of the scripting has documentation, and the rest is just a bit of learning from what's written and understanding code flow.

137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/21/2019 12:10 PM,You gotta decide what you want to do,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/21/2019 12:10 PM,"1. Kits come as boxes, not the item model",,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/21/2019 12:10 PM,2. Use the real model in hand but just use normal place action on it without the kit,,
137658517615149056,helkhiana,11/21/2019 12:10 PM,3. Do not let pick up if stuff inside,,

153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:11 PM,The real problem,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:11 PM,is for my weaponcase,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:11 PM,its the same,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,11/21/2019 12:11 PM,For weapon case I could see using a kit,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:12 PM,thanks a lot,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:12 PM,i will just dont creat a kit for weaponcase,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:12 PM,so its a item like other,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:12 PM,and gunrack,,
153562419128565760,starnain,11/21/2019 12:12 PM,cant take it without dismount,,
