674046484303577109,futuresixx,01/22/2021 3:49 AM,"no, its the fact with incarinventory, you can loot anything in the vicinity while in the vehicle. Now with vehicle modders making their vehicle in-penetrable, it present the issue with mission mods, airdrops, or king of the hill. as they can pull up, be completely protected in their vehcile, and never have to leave it, because they can simple inventory anything on the ground into their inventory. 

I can't remember is its MuchCarKey or dayz in general that blocks inventory access, unless a door is open, so that helps with this issue a little bit, being they have to open a door to put loot on the ground into the vehicles inventory, but as for as loot to personal inventory thats where the true issue is",,

I think even with the door just being open, while player is vehicle should disable the player from looting into personal inventory and vehicle inventory also

Reason being is, this can make where the passenger just has to the open the door, or they can ride around without a trunk, and be able to loot without leaving vehicle",,

272245679013888011,marioe,01/31/2021 12:47 PM,"Why almost no one asks animation related questions in the actual #animations-dayz channel?.
Anyway, your item is most likely just missing the definition for that animation in it's animation set instance, so add 
```
""ActionInLoopOut.MineRockErc.Cancel"" ""{4DFBC69D30E8F7D7}DZ/anims/anm/player/actions/horticulture/p_erc_pickaxe_dig_cancel.anm""
   ""ActionInLoopOut.MineRockErc.InLoopOut"" ""{C9E8B7E3314194D6}DZ/anims/anm/player/actions/horticulture/p_erc_pickaxe_mine.anm""
  
```
to your .asi for your item",,
