334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:48 AM,i think its understandable by this why it can not be modded,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:49 AM,Oh it is an engine class indeed,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:49 AM,I think potentially you can't mod anything that defines anything proto?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:51 AM,haven't really checked that if i modded something that has proto,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:52 AM,"For example you can't mod ""Magazine""",,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 1:54 AM,Does anyone have an example of send/receive custom RPC working?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:55 AM,"you can send it on mostly anything, but can receive it on a low amount of classes",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:55 AM,best one to use is playerbase,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:55 AM,"that's the most ""versatile"" function to work with RPCs",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:56 AM,"ScriptRPC rpc = new ScriptRPC();
    rpc.Write(""string"");
    rpc.Send(null, your_rpc_name, true);",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:57 AM,send it like this,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:57 AM,"you can write as many data as you want, just remember the sequence",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,then read it like this,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,"void OnRPC(ParamsReadContext ctx)
        {
            string text;

            ctx.Read(text);
        }",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,You could probably capture the RPC in DayZGame?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,"Even if you can access the RPC, you cant really do much from there",,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,Right becuse atm I'm in the missionGameplay,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,DayZGame is a LVL3 function right?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:58 AM,you cant intercept RPCs in missionGameplay,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,lvl3 class i mean,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,Oh damn really?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,"You can send RPCs from missionGameplay, but cant receive",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,"and also, missionGameplay is client side",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,"Oh, due to the funky auto-include system you mean?",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 1:59 AM,"also, the way the hierarchy works in the game",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,If you have a class in LVL4,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,that explains with whats being happening lmao,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,you cant access 5_Mission from 4_World,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,but you can access 4_World from 5_Mission,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,you can acces 1-2-3-4 from 5,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,you can go downwards but not upwards,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:00 AM,that's why you have to be careful where you define specific classes,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:01 AM,"for example i have my player database inside 4_World, because i wan't to access it from PlayerBase",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:01 AM,Explains why there are no references to PlayerBase in 3_Game,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:01 AM,if it would be in 5_Mission i wouldnt be able to do that,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:02 AM,So where would be the best place for keypress > send rpc > teleport player or spawn an item?,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/09/2018 2:02 AM,Updated my server and i can login with the mod by Da0ne but cant get commands to work?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:03 AM,"@CaptainCookie  is missionGameplay, you can forge the RPC by i showed u above",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:03 AM,for example on keypress,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:03 AM,"if(key == KeyCode.KC_O)
{}",,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:03 AM,Wait you just said it won't work to receive rpc?,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:03 AM,so how would it work?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,"i said, you cant receive RPC on missionGameplay",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,I'm assuming if you send an RPC to null then every object gets it?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,but you can send from there,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,"NULL means no target, so it sends it to the server",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,"no matter what, if you send from client, it will be sent to the server",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:04 AM,backwards it's different,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:05 AM,@CaptainCookie  make a C file called anything in 3_Game\Enums,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:05 AM,can be called anything,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:05 AM,make an enum in it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,"enum CookieRPC
{
rpc_cookie = 666;
}",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,this goes in there,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,this way you define a new RPC pointer,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,"this has to be in the servers / clients folder as well, so they can identify it",,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,I've got one of those in my 5_mission atm,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:06 AM,put it in 3_Game so 4 and 5 can access it,,
474231648842547210,cookie_commander,11/09/2018 2:07 AM,right,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:07 AM,you will need it from there,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:14 AM,the answer is right there,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:14 AM,PlayerBase is not Identity,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:15 AM,You're calling it on PlayerIdentity..,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:15 AM,get the player first,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:15 AM,identity.GetPlayer().getEnvironment(),,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:15 AM,m_player.GetEnvironment() instead,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:15 AM,so @CaptainCookie  i 'll write you a quick example how can you send an RPC on key press,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 2:16 AM,"Hum, I though that was correct cause when I highlight it with my cursor it tell me a method returning playerbase",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 2:16 AM,Thank's boys,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:16 AM,yes because identity refers to playerbase at some point,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:16 AM,but its not the same,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:17 AM,as i said earlier you can get identity from player and player from identity,,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,11/09/2018 2:17 AM,Yep I'll send you a pm,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:17 AM,@CaptainCookie  this goes into your missionGameplay onKeypress,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:18 AM,i do that,,

261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:26 AM,Yes.... PlayerBase inherits from Man,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:26 AM,So PlayerBase has a GetIdentity() function,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:27 AM,class Man is surely referriing to Hu*man*,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 2:27 AM,whereas Managed is probably an implementation detail,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:28 AM,Man is like the deepest function you would want to go,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:28 AM,already too deep,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:28 AM,you can do mostly anything in 3_Game 4_World 5_Mission by defining new classes and modding some,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 2:32 AM,tho i hope they fix the FileSerialize in the game,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 5:38 AM,Another question xD Is there something like FileSerialization for xml files or does I have to read them Line by Line with FileHandle?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 5:38 AM,Thanks 😄,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 5:47 AM,make a function that should handle it,,

135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 6:06 AM,"Look at class: ""class JsonFileLoader"", I remember somebody sent me a very good example, I'll try to find it",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:07 AM,well...you could get them to save by just adding it to teh db xml,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:07 AM,"in types.xml anything you add, it will save it",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:07 AM,no mater what Entity is,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:07 AM,"itembase, buidlings whateverv",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:07 AM,The vehicles which get spawned by the server events are persistent so I think I have to use something other then creategameobject or maybe set a flag on that object,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,11/09/2018 6:08 AM,"Didn't knew that, good one DaOnly",,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:08 AM,Ah ok ^^,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:09 AM,Really strange is that I had spawned a garden plot with creategameobject and it's persistent :0,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:09 AM,yea thst beacsue its in the xmls,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:09 AM,of types,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:09 AM,and it has a lifetime,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:10 AM,But I have not added it to the xml,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:10 AM,"also in the cfg of an item, by changing its base types the db will save it according to that",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:10 AM,so lets say a hunting bag is ContainerBase so it will save in conatiner.bin,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:10 AM,Hmmm okay,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:11 AM,is the CE tool out?,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:11 AM,So some types of some baseclasses are persistent,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:11 AM,im pretty sure with that you should be able to create a 'custom' save .bin,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:11 AM,my db generates a custom.bin and its always empty,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:12 AM,I would be happy if I just could spawn vehicles like the server does,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:12 AM,Then it should be persistent,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:12 AM,just add them to the types xml,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:12 AM,give it a lifetime,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:12 AM,and let server events do the spawning,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:13 AM,https://gyazo.com/6bf8ed7b34c7cd9e7325c5ab06621450,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:13 AM,see the lifetime is 3 secs,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:13 AM,by default,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:14 AM,Does it also saves the gear and attachments in the vehicle?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:14 AM,yes,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:14 AM,everything about it will save,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:15 AM,as long as it has a proper config for storevalues,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:15 AM,Aaah I think I get it now,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:15 AM,Butt I need to spawn it at runtime,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:16 AM,It's for the trader Mod,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:16 AM,Spawning and attachments of cars wor fine now but it gets despawned like I mentioned,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:18 AM,hmmm...ok well here try this...,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:18 AM,Maybe I don't  get it right xD What exactly does the XML you have mentioned,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:18 AM,spawn your cars via your script,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:18 AM,before you do that edit the db lifetime for cars,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:18 AM,make sure to spawn the car and cast it to its base,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:19 AM,it should save it,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:19 AM,But why are the cars which gets spawned by the server persistent then?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:20 AM,because its configed via server events,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:20 AM,thats handled diffrent,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:20 AM,Hmmm okk,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:20 AM,So what exactly do you mean by DB lifetime?,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:20 AM,go to types.xml,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,and search for 'CivilainSedan',,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,Aaaaahhhh,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,or any vehicle,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,and you will see the lifetime is 3 sec,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,And standard is 3sec,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,change that to whatever you wish,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,Yess I get now what types XML does xD sry,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:21 AM,use google conversation to get days to sec,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:22 AM,make sure you delete your storage and let it regenerate again,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:22 AM,I hope they use int 64 internally,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/09/2018 6:23 AM,And I also hope that the cars which was spawned by Event doesn't get spawned twice then :D,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:23 AM,lol,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,11/09/2018 6:23 AM,will see,,

```m_StaminaHandler = new StaminaHandler(this);```

241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:57 PM,yes,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/09/2018 6:57 PM,ok,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,uncheck all your mods from the mods tab,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,and try that,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,Btw is there any way to obfuscate C code?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,and the pbo as well,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,Yes but this isnt C code,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,"well, then EnScript",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,Oh in that case,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,I mean you can randomize class and function names?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,No tools for it,,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,you can do crypt/decrypt gay stuff,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,"that's not really what i mean by obfuscating, i mean fully crypting the code",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:58 PM,I thought of making it but arkensor says he wants to do pbo obfuscation,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,like maverick did in arma 3,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,mavericks version was poop,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,arkensors was the only one that wasn't cracked,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,so I'd wait for him and optix to bring their tool to dayz,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,"but ya rn, no tools for that",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 6:59 PM,Can you guys send me a pbo that Arkensor crypted?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,"I don't have one, sorry",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,because yeah you're right Mavericks one is shitty,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,"well, if you know how it works",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,"but its easy to unpack, so not really secure",,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,Maverick updated his after arkensors came out,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,so I think he just kinda rammed it through,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:00 PM,arkensors used a server authentication system to decrypt the code,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:01 PM,its was genius,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:01 PM,"yeah i was thinking about that, had an idea as well",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:01 PM,i did some kind of server side encryption back in the day on GTA,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:01 PM,needed the servers permission to decrypt and load the code but wasnt readable from memory,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:01 PM,Does enforce have RSA implementation exposed from their engine?,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:02 PM,because that would  be sick,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:02 PM,i have no idea,,
241370201222938626,kegan.eth,11/09/2018 7:02 PM,I could store BR stats per server encrypted on the client machine,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 7:02 PM,I'll scan the game for encrypt related keywords,,

261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 10:56 PM,"E.g. create a menu, use hotkeys to send RPCs. Or still just chatline, but just don't send it as a regular chat but send an RPC instead, if a command is detected",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,if you detect a command on client,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,"you can ""block"" the message",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,it wont appear on client,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,but still sends it to the server,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,"so when the client sends a message, i think that is a native function in the game we cant assess",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,i already spent a lot of time trying to block the message from going out,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:01 PM,Hmm,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,so we have to block it on server side,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,Presumably you were looking at ChatInputMenu?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,i looked into all the scripts that is related to the chat,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,but i'll look into the server side events n shit later,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,i'm just trying to get the workbench to work,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:02 PM,I would have thought that if the UI for the text input box was implemented in script we'd have full control of what happens when they hit enter..,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:03 PM,the ChatInput is just the ui element you see n shit,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:03 PM,the message event that happens,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:03 PM,i have no idea where that is,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:03 PM,even Chat.c has nothing to do with it,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:03 PM,"But it's the UI that you interact with - you type the text in, then press enter",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"override bool OnChange(Widget w, int x, int y, bool finished)",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,Which I assume would be where this is fired,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"yes, but that chat is client side",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"your chat, is not the same as the one sends the message",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,that's why you can remove the chat message on client,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,but the server still sees it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"there is a function, i don't know which file",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,Can you stop it from sending to the server tho?,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"GetGame().ChatPlayer(/*GetGame().ChatGetChannel()*/0, text);",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:04 PM,"it checks if the message is  == """" then returns",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:05 PM,I would assume that would be the one sending it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:05 PM,"if you remove the message on client side in all the chat scripts, it still sends it on server",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:05 PM,good point i will check the ChatPlayer function itself,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:05 PM,it its accessible,,
