582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:05 PM,you will get their dayz is class based language not function based so most vars are a class in some way,,
106922508707434496,thecrimsonzamboni,07/22/2023 8:07 PM,I have no problems overriding EEKilled in ZombieBase without errors,,
228658618684276736,itzdusty,07/22/2023 8:08 PM,"But if I understand your example.

1. expPlugin class, extends the playerbase and defines expAddPlayer as a method, the method sends a message to the killing player saying that they've been awarded some experience. It then calls the saveEXP in order to save the EXP to the player.

2. PluginManager, you modded the PluginManager to register the expPlugin, this ensures that it gets initialized or ?

3. Playerbade modded class, you added an instance of expPlugin and modded the EEKilled function, so that when a player is killed the function checks if the expPlugin is active, if it is the expAddPlayer method of the expPlugin is called and then sends a message to the killer?",,
582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:09 PM,"interesting i tryed before for kill feed but got nothing but issues and errors 
but then again bear traps never used to rigger a players eekilled function so maybe bohemia fixed a few things",,
228658618684276736,itzdusty,07/22/2023 8:11 PM,"Maybe something like this would be possible?

```

modded class PluginManager {
    override void Init() {
        super.Init();

        Print(""[EventPlugin] :: Plugin Registered"");

modded class PlayerBase {
    EventPlugin m_EventPlugin;

    // Assuming EEKilled exists for the version of DayZ you're working with:
    override void EEKilled(Object killer) {
        super.EEKilled(killer);

            m_EventPlugin.OnPlayerDeath(PlayerBase.Cast(this), killer);

            }
        }
    };
};

modded class ZombieBase {
    EventPlugin m_EventPlugin;

    // As we are not certain about the direct ZombieBase death function, this is a placeholder. You'll need to find and hook into the correct event or method.
    void PlaceholderZombieDeathFunction() {
        // Check if killed by player and if our plugin exists
        if (m_EventPlugin) {

582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:17 PM,"yes by registering a plugin you can get the plug in from most areas of the game with 
```EventPlugin  m_EventPlugin   = GetPlugin(EventPlugin ); `

m_EventPlugin.OnPlayerDeath()``` etc",,
582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:17 PM,the code i posted hasnt been ran so its probbly got a few errors but the idea is their,,
582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:18 PM,overide a fuction  to get some data then pass it to your plugin to do somthing with the data,,
582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:21 PM,"i think for what your doing i would have at the bottom of 
```c
class EventPlugin extends PluginBase{ } 

static ref EventPlugin g_EventPlugin ;
static ref EventPlugin GetEventPlugin (){
    if (!g_EventPlugin ){
        g_EventPlugin  = new EventPlugin ;
    }
    return g_EventPlugin ;
};
```
so when you want to call a function for your plugin you can do 
`GetEventPlugin () . function name ()`",,
228658618684276736,itzdusty,07/22/2023 8:24 PM,"I see, so may be something like:
```
class EventPlugin {
    void OnZombieDeath(PlayerBase killer) {
        Param1<string> m_MessageParam = new Param1<string>( killer.GetIdentity().GetPlainName() + "" killed a zombie."" );

        Print(killer.GetIdentity().GetPlainName() + "" killed a zombie."");

228658618684276736,itzdusty,07/22/2023 8:25 PM,"For this type of script, would I pack it and use the Addon Builder, upload to workshop and all that or is this something that needs to be server-side and manually installed on the server?",,
582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/22/2023 8:29 PM,"yes save righting the same 2  - 3 lines over and over 

your class will still have to extend plugin  tho 

you can test with the work bench app rather than publishing and ||repacking 😄 || for every change 

```c
modded class PluginManager {
    override void Init() {
        super.Init(); 
        RegisterPlugin(""EventPlugin"", true, true); // the first true tells the game load this mod on the players pc / client  the second is load on server 
        Print(""[EventPlugin] :: Plugin Registered"");
    };
};
```
you can do `RegisterPlugin(""EventPlugin"", false , true);`
so the server doesnt need the players to down load the mod as its not using any code needed on the players pc",,
228658618684276736,itzdusty,07/22/2023 8:30 PM,Where in the file structure shjould something like this be installed though? 😄,,

I have two mods that use the same key binds to access their panels.

i found the quest's mod input.xml file and made the following adjustment in line 23.
created a new addon/mod and added it to the server however it does not seem to take effect.

Need some help again.

I have headphones to be attached to a helmet.

if attached it shows a selection and hides another one.
If on ground/in inventory it switches them.

```
class TMA_FastMT_Headphones_Base extends ItemBase
{
    EntityAI m_Parent;
    
    void TMA_FastMT_Headphones_Base()
    {
        ShowSelection(""ground"");
        HideSelection(""attached"");
    }
    
    override void EEInit()
    {
        super.EEInit();

        ShowSelection(""ground"");
        HideSelection(""attached"");
    }
    
    override void OnWasAttached( EntityAI parent, int slot_id )
    {
        super.OnWasAttached(parent, slot_id);
        m_Parent = parent;
        
        HideSelection(""ground"");
        ShowSelection(""attached"");
    }
    
    override void OnWasDetached( EntityAI parent, int slot_id )
    {
        super.OnWasDetached(parent, slot_id);
        m_Parent = null;
        
        ShowSelection(""ground"");
        HideSelection(""attached"");
    }
    
};```

I used ``void EEInit()`` to set it spawning with the attached version to be hidden.

All works well, but when I restart/reconnect, the headphones when attached to the helmet show the ground version.
What could be the solution to still have it look like the ground model when spawned in, but not when attached after reconnect?",,

582657474159575050,lankycraig,07/29/2023 5:34 PM,not for compressing them but depending on how you store or use the compressed data having them as hex  means if you want to reverse it back to readable string the 0x  can be a point to split in to a array the convert them back to char or string,,

        case m_StatisticsButton:
            // Handle Statistics button click

I have a Question about Modding, because i´m trying to build a crafting Mod for my personal Server.   
But im totaly confused how all of this works.   


Ive had an ""Template"" but this one dosen´t work. So can Someone help me there?  

Because the Problem is, that everytime i start my Server and my Game, my Game says that the ""Mod"" is not on the Server. But it is, and i dont rly know what to do. And I write it in the .bat file too",,

if i have data that need to be kept with out clearing i do
```c

static ref someclass g_someclass ;
static ref someclass Getsomeclass (){
    if (!g_KillFeedLanky){

582657474159575050,lankycraig,08/01/2023 12:25 PM,but the client is adding the mod as its in the -mods= list,,

582657474159575050,lankycraig,08/01/2023 12:35 PM,"the item isnt in you mod then so 

it could all be handled server side  as Expansion could be responcible for adding the info to the player",,
365131869827760128,thesimuking,08/01/2023 12:36 PM,"yeah that point is clear expansion is adding the info to me.

582657474159575050,lankycraig,08/01/2023 12:36 PM,vadym has a point did you sign the mod and put your key file in to the server keys folder ?,,

463071759521021953,vadymbabii,08/01/2023 12:44 PM,"I believe that's problem not in the code. You need to doublecheck all the pathes to mod and resign it. The client loads the same mod as the server, but diff between somewhere in metadata of mods",,
