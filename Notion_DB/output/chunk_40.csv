I've made a script file for modifying some values - PlayerConstants.c

    static const float SHOES_MOVEMENT_DAMAGE_PER_STEP = 0.005; // 0.035 default

    static const float BLEEDING_SOURCE_BLOODLOSS_PER_SEC = -250; // -24 default (200 for test environment - 10 for live server)
    
    static const float UNCONSIOUSS_COOLDOWN_TIME = 30; // 60 default

The thing is that we over complicated it so we set a icon to a group of items eg. Snipers MP etc. 

To make it more compatible to weapon mods etc we'd like to set a Item Prev widget according to the killer weapon. And render it in the KillFeed, but since i never messed with the ItemPrevWidget i have 0 clue on how to even make it render a Item like eg. SVD",,♿ (1)

235718406492520448,niirozz,09/22/2019 11:01 PM,Use imageWidget instead,,

180029119638011904,lbmaster,09/29/2019 5:36 PM,You could make the lid a different selection and Maybe Place it somewhere Else Too (Duplicate it) and then make One invisible and the other One visible. So you Switch between Open and closed,,

135355238990348288,djctavia,09/30/2019 4:01 PM,JSON is easy to parse since you can directly parse param directly after a `load`,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,09/30/2019 4:01 PM,But it's more efficient to have file with constant format,,

2)  Is there an easy way to tell how many players are on your server?  That is something like ...```    array<Man> players = new array<Man>;

327640512570064898,digiacomtech,10/05/2019 9:03 PM,"@RoomService ... thanks for the response!

As to #1 ... I already have the file checks in place and it does exist (well beyond that point in development, with mod version control too).  What I'm doing now is adding new params to the JSON file, and if the server is loading an old file I need to know so I can set/default the values for them and then write out a new settings file for them.

As to #2 ... All I'm doing is checking the player count.  That is, given we need 5 players for 'something' to work ... if there are not enough players on the server (PlayerCount < 5) then I'll suspend 'something' until such time there are enough players (PlayerCount >= 5).",,

181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:40 PM,"I beg to pardon, but auto is to be used in every place EXCEPT very specific cases where you want to make 100% sure that the type matches and otherwise provoke compile errors",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:41 PM,"Auto is shorter to read, shorter to type and easier to come by when doing refactoring.",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:41 PM,"And no auto has no ""cost"", the increase in compile time is not measureable",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:41 PM,I use it in foreach loops,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:42 PM,"```
foreach (auto i: someArray)

135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:43 PM,"Totally disaccording with this, Arkensor, if you use it, that mean you have a bad syntax in your code. The existence of this is ok for small part of code they are readable in less than 20 lines, but not in whole class. It's use in CPP for avoiding things like: std::curiousvariable_ptr<::othershit::mystruct_t>, but on DayZ, or Enscript, that shouldn't exist",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:44 PM,Ugh but that's sooo long to type,,

208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:45 PM,"ok so the argument is, that not using auto at least helps to maintain the readability in case of bad variable names?",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:46 PM,"That the main reason, your free to use, but if people can't understand your code or you can't back on it easly, you'll have problem on huge projects",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:46 PM,"There really isn't standards set, I just base my structure and naming convention off of C#",,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:47 PM,"well if not using auto increases the readability of code measurable, then its an overall bad code. - but i think i get the argument",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:47 PM,here would be a good use of auto,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:48 PM,"`auto myArray = new map<string, ref array<string>>;`",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:48 PM,"Well, even if DayZ can be discuss about how it's codded in some part, search in whole files for ""auto"", you'll see really few of them",,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:48 PM,"Using the explicit variable type instead of compile time detection is something people did in 199X. Modern editors all feature highlighting and code previews to inspect data types if you really do need to know them. If the variable naming is good, you do not need to know the type to understand what it is.",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:48 PM,"Yeah Wardog, that a good exemple",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:49 PM,Enscript is custom C compile in CPP Arkensor,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:49 PM,That doesn't mean your auto are use like you expect,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:49 PM,Would like to know from team working on base engine about that,,
181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:49 PM,And this is not a personal preference from me or something. All languages started to push towards compile time detection. All languages feature it since a while and encourage the use of it.,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:50 PM,"yeah i feel the same as Arkensor, if the variables named properly, then has a chance to be more readable when using auto.",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:50 PM,"Using auto like this would generally make it hard to read
`auto value = GetID();`",,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:50 PM,but `auto vehicleid = GetID()` would not be hard to read,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:51 PM,"i don't care what an id is, i satisfied with knowing its an id",,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:51 PM,Honestly I'd have to check the return value of GetID to check to see what type I'm handling,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:51 PM,"Well, you can expect ID return an INT not a String",,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:51 PM,🤷,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:51 PM,But it's not always the case apparently,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:52 PM,can you? - and does it matter if its object oriented?,,
208239246148894720,teaobvious,10/08/2019 4:52 PM,if we work with base datatypes then i may agree. but once we go object oriented most things simply work if the objects are constructed properly,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:53 PM,Would agree if you work with class they are used on same way with same functions,,
135355238990348288,djctavia,10/08/2019 4:53 PM,Like a map,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,10/08/2019 4:53 PM,It depends on who's work you're reading,,

181864632216977408,arkensor,10/08/2019 4:53 PM,Auto is used exactly  how you would expect it to be and how any other language treats it. All it does is compare the right statement and evaluate the compile time type and use that.,,
