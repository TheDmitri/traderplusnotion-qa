355480921601998848,livingxdead,05/19/2021 10:37 PM,So like soon as one appears my script replaces it with an actual random one from the array,,

185896664110727168,osodirty,05/19/2021 10:40 PM,"basically placeHolder.c and in side you would have

  void placeHolder()

    //code to replace it's self here

```c
itmbase = ItemBase.Cast(GetGame().CreateObject(crtItems.Result, this.GetPosition(), false));

This is creating 0 Ammo (Just Bulleticon with 0/20) if i set it to 1 its create 1 Ammo but i want to define it via json when i type in 20 in the json file it crafts 20x 1 Ammo.",,
185896664110727168,osodirty,05/20/2021 8:50 PM,It can be done. You just need to have a look at some mods/scripts that use json configs.,,
105616222434893824,spurgle,05/20/2021 9:26 PM,"so had a issue with my bag mod/
more so the Smersh bag when attached to my military bag, couldn't put items in the Smersh bag when attached to my bag.

tracked the cause of this down to clothing_base.c
and found the function that allow cargo manipulation when the smersh bag is attached to the smersh vest. 
👍 

so i have made it work with my bag now, by modding the function for the smersh bag.


this is the vanilla function
```c
bool SmershException(EntityAI hierarchyParent)
    {
        EntityAI hp = hierarchyParent.GetHierarchyParent();
        if (hp)
        {
            if (!hp.IsMan())
                return false;
        }
        
        return IsInherited(SmershBag) && hierarchyParent.IsInherited(SmershVest);
    }
```",,
105616222434893824,spurgle,05/20/2021 9:26 PM,"and here's mine

```c

    }

105616222434893824,spurgle,05/20/2021 9:26 PM,"or is it better to do it like this...

104260816999575552,roybeer,05/21/2021 9:50 AM,Is it possible to create a script that moves the player camera? I'm trying to create a scene with a moving camera that does some complex behaviour but doing it in FreeCam alone is too error prone. I tried using AutoHotkey to input the commands but it seems during FreeCam the mouse input is handled differently -- the directive to move the cursor every so slightly to the side increases the FoV into regions that it crashes my game,,

im trying to get some position information on objects in game so I can make an entry in mapgrouppos.xml

I can get the ""pos="" part by using GetWorldPosition() and I can get ""rpy="" by using GetOrientation(); or even GetYawPitchRoll();, but what about poor ""a=""?  what can I use to fill that? I know with a bit of math I can work it out but surely there is a similar function to use?",,👍 (1)

So I thought, I should change those, with my own `MAXIMUM_RESULTS` value like so:
string m_ItemsToCreate[**20**];
or:
string m_ItemsToCreate **= 20**;

However both option don't see, to work, since I have no idea how the `[]` parts works. I thought it is an indexer? So I don't get it why and how it used to set a variable.",,

 Have the action only take a certain quantity. Then a recipe to fill it back up with saline bags. Cast to ItemBase and use GetQuantity() and SetQuantity()",,❤️ (1)

Even some third party tools for free that are way better than vanilla. Set up P drive. Extract game data. Use a template to have a proper config.cpp for compiling scripts and overriding vanilla or modded data.,,
