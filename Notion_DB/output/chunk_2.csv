142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,thats to do with eye adaptation,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,and it happens irl,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,just overly exaggerated in dayz,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,and in a lot of other games,,
392049979692285963,DrZedRP#8858,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,so its just an optimization thingy?,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,10/07/2018 1:54 PM,Simulation of your retina,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 1:59 PM,aus here the ambient light is brighter than say uk,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:00 PM,once ur eyes get super adjusted everything looks a bit washed out here.,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:00 PM,go back into your house and its pitch black xD,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 2:02 PM,"If I understand correctly, I can't use FreeDebugCamera as a spectator on the server if multiple people want to use freecam in multiplayer since there is just one instance?",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:02 PM,negative,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:02 PM,camera is client side,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 2:28 PM,"But doesn't this create one on the server `SelectSpectator(sender, ""FreeDebugCamera"", player.GetPosition());` , where sender is an instance of PlayerIdentity and player an instance of PlayerBase (in rpc in this case)",,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:28 PM,it should just mean it starts tracking the camera,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 2:31 PM,You wouldn't have an example of using this by any chance?,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 2:31 PM,?,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 2:33 PM,You had that stream snippet of it but it has disappeared. I'm just trying to figure out how to exactly implement this freecamming on both client and server sides,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 3:15 PM,That was client side only,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 3:15 PM,I'm beginning to believe that it must be actived server side with selectspectator and have it update its position using UpdateSpectator,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 3:16 PM,for network bubble,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 4:03 PM,Oh okay.,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:03 PM,just got it working like that,,
106435033203482624,kerkkoh,10/07/2018 4:05 PM,So you spawn in a camera on client and just run selectSpectator on the server? @DaOne(Mark),,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:06 PM,running selectSpectator does not seem to work properly,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:06 PM,unless im missing something here,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 4:07 PM,selectspecaator is server side,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:09 PM,"yea, the update spectator is client, however the command does not do shit",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:09 PM,could be me,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,10/07/2018 4:09 PM,still testing,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,10/07/2018 4:09 PM,?,,
