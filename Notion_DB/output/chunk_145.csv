Custom placed buildings. Deleting proxies is not possible unless you do a prefix override and provide your own model. And even then you’re still limited to the same restrictions we have now.

I don't have custom textures made for it yet, just the textures that came with the model, does that matter in the case of using ""zbytek"" or ""camo""?

The model.cfg was more or less the same one from TWE4KS YouTube tutorial, where he shows how to import a custom weapon into DayZ. Most of my code is based on that, and since it's only 5ish months old I figured I'd trust it. I only referenced custom weapon mods for the added variables they've used.

```NULL pointer to instance

bl_deposit\scripts\4_World/entities\bl_deposit_container.c:25

JM/CF/Scripts/3_Game/communityframework\game\dayzgame.c:23
VPPAdminTools/3_Game/vppadmintools\vanillaplusplus.c:211```

And this is the Function:


```    static bool FindContainerByID( int ID )
    {
        if( ID )
        {
            foreach(int i, bl_deposit_container Container: m_DepositContainer)

I mean... I can get rid of the NULL pointer by changing the condition to `if( Container && Container.GetContainerID() == ID )`
... but how is this even possible? The Array that gets looped seems to have empty spots?

If I have for example an array with 4 values, I have index 0-3 - if I delete the position 0, all other positions should move up - like: position 1 is now on 0, 2 on 1, 3 on 2... am i right?",,
