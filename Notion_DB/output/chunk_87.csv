```
modded class DayZPlayerMeleeFightLogic_LightHeavy
{
  void EvaluateHit(InventoryItem weapon)
```
Wouldn't `EvaluateHit()` have to be overridden?
Second thing: Sometimes, we see a null point exception on `weapon.GetHierarchyRootPlayer()`. It seems `weapon` is NULL sometimes. As I said, I know you don't support it anymore. It's ok if I never hear from you concerning this.",,

272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:09 PM,but if you do `ClassB myClass = new ClassB()`,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:09 PM,Then it will serialzie variables defined in ClassA and ClassB,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:09 PM,It has the object,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:09 PM,Yeah,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:09 PM,But it's not a variable,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:10 PM,The serializer uses strictly a variable to identify the class,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,05/06/2021 3:10 PM,"yeah I know that, I have some experience with OOP üôÇ thanks for the explanation tho üòÑ
The thing that I don't understand is why `this` is not `ClassImpl`",,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:10 PM,with only `this` then it will recognize is as `Class`,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,05/06/2021 3:11 PM,but the serializer correclty serializes the fields in ClassBase ü§î,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:12 PM,"if you do 
```
    ClassImpl myImpl = this;    
    m_serializer.WriteToString(myImpl, true, result);
```",,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:12 PM,Then it will be able to read the values,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:12 PM,"`m_serializer.WriteToString(this, true, result);`
will not work properly",,

272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:19 PM,Because it is based on a script variable,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:19 PM,And checks the type on it,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:19 PM,`this` is not technically a script variable,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:19 PM,"Why is it done like that?, idk",,
207902577713479680,simonvic,05/06/2021 3:20 PM,mmmh yeah that explains it. Thanks!,,
207902577713479680,simonvic,05/06/2021 3:20 PM,yeah apparently also other modders don't like to use `this` lol,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:20 PM,They like to use it,,
272245679013888011,marioe,05/06/2021 3:20 PM,what they do not like is this.MyMethod,,

135226527473336320,inclementdab,05/10/2021 9:27 AM,normally you just store a constant that holds that value,,
