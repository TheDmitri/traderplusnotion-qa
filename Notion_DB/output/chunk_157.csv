Now that i'm trying to add the modifier to a custom pelt base it's acting as if the code is non existent and not being read. Does anyone have any ideas? Is there a different way to change the size of a model that goes in your hands as opposed to zombies? The code I'm using is currently below.

I'm trying to create a new grenade class and give it a more refined shrapnel mechanic. 
Now I've seen that the Explosion() takes a damage and ammotype. And then most of the time a M67_ammo is called or whatever the class is and then it's defined in the CfgAmmo.
Now, I'm assuming the ammo type is what handles the damage cause I've seen several parameters called for simulation= like shotshell, and shell,  but I'm having trouble finding exactly where those are defined.",,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,07/11/2023 1:10 PM,"The general way of handling your case would be:

Adapt the mod to recognize if any of its data shall be saved or not (skipping its own OnStoreSave logic)

Start the server with the mod already installed and make it aware that it shall not safe anything.

Let the server run for a few minutes so that every item is saved eventually (but without your stuff).

Shutdown the server.

Remove the mod.",,

```

        return parentCargo.GetWidth() * parentCargo.GetHeight();

This results in exactly what I wanted, checking the cargo size of a parent item to then limit something from being placed into containers with a cargo size less than a certain value via something like this:
```
override bool CanPutInCargo(EntityAI parent)
    {
        if (!super.CanPutInCargo(parent))
            return false;

        if(parent.IsContainer() && (GetParentCargoCapacity(parent) <= 24))

Context, there's the Search Inventory mod which is great, however the default hot key is O which is already used by another mod on our server. Looking to create an override to make it a different default hot key. Yes, I know you can change it via the the in game control settings, but then it still conflicts for players unless they do the same and resets when you join a different server (like when I switch between our production and test servers).",,

the check for a bat and power is 
`if ( !state && GetCompEM().CanWork() )`

`if ( !state  )`",,
189097125521522699,thejeremy,07/19/2023 8:51 PM,"No idea how this should work tho.

I mean. I dont want a battery to be on it.

I will mostly do some scummy and aboslutely stupid way giving the visor on spawn a battery, hide the slot and this will work.
Sadly it will count the battery into the whole CE and spawning part, but I cant be arsed. Simply cant find any solution which makes sense to me.

In
```
void RotateGoggles(bool state)
    {
        //if ( GetAnimationPhase(""rotate"") != state ) //useless?
            SetAnimationPhase(""rotate"",!state);
        m_IsLowered = !state;
        
        PlayerBase player;
        int slot_id;
        string slot_name;
        if ( m_Strap && m_Strap.GetInventory().GetCurrentAttachmentSlotInfo(slot_id,slot_name) && PlayerBase.CastTo(player, m_Strap.GetHierarchyParent())/*&& slot_id == InventorySlots.EYEWEAR*/ )
        {
            player.SetNVGLowered(m_IsLowered);
        }
        
        if ( GetCompEM() )
        {
            if ( !state && GetCompEM().CanWork() )

            else
                GetCompEM().SwitchOff();
        }
    }``` 

There is m_lowered which to me should be used and checking for it, but no idea how to implement it.

As to where it only checks for if m_IsLowered show overlay and if !m_IsLowered hide it.
But couldnt get it done. lol",,
