102171754071334912,ralian,03/11/2021 6:03 AM,That's why my server just suddenly started timing me out when I launched it with my mod,,

You know the weird thing is though, I was  playing around with selection positions of the player model on the server side. Before I would find the selection position on the server, then pass a point to make a debug particle at via RPC like

You would think there would be an easier way to get the position of a held item than attaching a particle to it, then getting the partilce position. But if it works it works.

I've made a weapon attachment, that on an action is changed to another weapon attachments by lambda
I don't want this attachments to be able to be taken off from the gun by a player until you do the action again and it changes back

So I did this
`override bool CanDetachAttachment`
and set it to false for that attachments
I thought this would make it so players couldn't pull it off, which is the case, but it also means the action can no longer switch it out either

Is there anyway to make it so this attachment can't be detached by a player but it can be force switched using a lambda type thing?",,
