356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:17 AM,"notepadd++ search in files ""What Fucntion I need to know more about""",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:18 AM,"Basically unpack the scripts.pbo and ""Find in files"" with notepad++",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:18 AM,filter in .c,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:18 AM,Look for `ReceiveRPC` `OnRPC`,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:18 AM,I can give you an example wait,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/28/2018 4:19 AM,"Ultimately, you'd probably want something like...

```c
GetGame().RPCSingleParam(player.GetIdentity(), Client_RPCs.Client_SEND_NAME, new Param1<string>(player.GetIdentity().GetName()), false, NULL );
```",,
456226577798135808,Deleted User,11/28/2018 4:21 AM,hm okay,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:22 AM,"On Server it sends a bool:
`Param1<bool> crpClr = new Param1<bool>( THEBOOLVARYOUTRYTOSEND );
GetGame().RPCSingleParam(player, TRPCs.RPC_SEND_TRADER_CLEAR, crpClr, true, player.GetIdentity());`

On Client it has a Function called `void OnRPC(PlayerIdentity sender, int rpc_type, ParamsReadContext ctx)`

In this Client Function there is a part likes this:
`case TRPCs.RPC_SEND_TRADER_CLEAR:
        ref Param1<bool> rp = new Param1<bool>( false );
        ctx.Read( rp );
                    
        THEBOOLVARONCLIENT = rp.param1;
break;`",,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:23 AM,This is an example for a bool,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:24 AM,the TRPCs is a own Enum I made with RPC_SEND_TRADER_CLEAR in it,,

356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:34 AM,no problem 😉,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/28/2018 4:35 AM,also I would recommend using RPCFramework,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:35 AM,@Jacob_Mango  it seems that DayZPlayerImplement doesnt knwo the Class MissionServer,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/28/2018 4:36 AM,nah it won't since the MissionServer is created in the project 5_Mission. The child knows about classes in the parent but the parent project doesn't know about the child classes.,,
356557233578049537,dr_j0nes,11/28/2018 4:36 AM,yeah ^^ so no chance at getting MissionServer/Gloabl Vars from DayzPlayerImplement?,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/28/2018 4:37 AM,and yeah. I recommend using RPCFramework if you want to guarantee cross mod compatibility with other mods since otherwise who knows how many different mods would use the name M_RPC class and/or may overlap with RPC ID's.,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,11/28/2018 4:38 AM,"nope, no chance",,

```
v2 hardens the security e.g by more thorough verification of the game content.
v1 is known to be broken - aka, addons could be modified (e.g for cheating) and still pass the signature check.
There were several issues left in the early v2 implementation, but these should be resolved in latest OA v1.60betas.
Server admins are recommended to run v2 signatures enabled with the latest Betas (or official v1.60 release once out), and also enable BattlEye (combined they provide the highest level of protection).

334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,im saying have a scripts folder in the pbo,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,then put the 3_Game in scripts,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,thats what I thought,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,ive done that,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,Im calling the mod on server start,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:40 AM,and I have other mods working,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,but honestly you should unpack dta/scripts.pbo,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,and mvoe the scripts folder to server root,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,and work there,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,to learn stuff,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,Is that possible?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,seeing that you don't really know what pbo prefix is i guess you never did anything for dayz / arma,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,so you should start at the basics,,
240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 3:41 AM,I actually ran 3 servers for the mod,,

240966515938164736,BeenJamminShapiro#3508,12/03/2018 4:09 AM,so I figured I could just recompile the scripts.pbo and place back to its native directory,,
