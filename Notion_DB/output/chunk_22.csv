206150525123559426,wbulot,01/13/2019 3:00 AM,"Hi guys,
I try to understand how damage works on zombies, I put the folowing in ZombieBase to test : 
```
override void EEHitBy(TotalDamageResult damageResult, int damageType, EntityAI source, int component, string dmgZone, string ammo, vector modelPos)
{
    super.EEHitBy(damageResult, damageType, source, component, dmgZone, ammo, modelPos);
    
    if ( damageResult)
    {
        Print(damageResult.GetDamage(dmgZone, ""Health""));
        Print(damageResult.GetDamage(dmgZone, ""Shock""));
        Print(damageResult.GetDamage(dmgZone, ""Blood""));
    }    
}
```
But the results doesnt make any sense.
For example with the fnx, damageResult prints the exact same results whatever the dmgZone: 
75
20
100

Same results when I hit the head or the leftarm. But the damage seems to be different because it needs 1 bullet on the head, but 3 on the arm to kill the Z. 
So what actually are those numbers if they are not the real damages i'm doing to the Z ? And where can I check the real damages ?
Thank you",,

Things like your basic programming concepts, conditionals, looping, collections and arrays, primitive data types, objects, classes...I think I could go on for quite a while.

You don't need to learn any other languages before you learn EnforceScript, actually I feel it would be best for you to learn enforcescript in its ""buggy"" state, you would be able to create something in a world which you could also interact with instead of printing `hello world` to a console for hours. I don't think anyone is ""struggling"" with the language, others can choose to speak up for themselves, it is just learning the built-in functions, and other things built into the API. 

Personally, I look things up whenever I have questions, but it's never because of syntax errors. Just read the files that are stored inside of the scripts.pbo, which is packaged with your game.

What's the best way with TextListbox to add multi columns data.
I mean if I do this :
```
myTextBox.AddItem(""text1"", NULL, 0 );
myTextBox.AddItem(""text2"", NULL, 1 );
myTextBox.AddItem(""text3"", NULL, 2 );
```
It will add each text to a new row.
I could use SetText after the first addItem to add second and third column by selecting the column number but I don't know if it's the best way to do that.",,

is how it needs to be written and must be before your Main()

then you must include 
```cpp

inside of main.
I believe most people put it above this line:

I built on top of MergHQ‚Äôs crash site code (forked repo / no license / small rudimentary project). My goal is given a full array of crash sites, delete all previously spawned crash sites and all nearby objects (including previously spawned gear/weapons), then spawn a completely new random subset of the full array of crash sites. 

All is working, but the GetGame().ObjectDelete(object) code. Crash sites persist and previously spawned crash sites and loot re-appear on every server restart. 

Any advice?
