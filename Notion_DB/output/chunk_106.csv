272245679013888011,marioe,12/01/2021 2:01 PM,"I see people always getting this issue... The constant that you feed the action for ""the animation"" is not tied to an animation directly, in fact technically it does not even have to be tied to a specific animation. It is tied to a transition in the action state machines of the player animation graph. depending if it is fullbody or not then it will look for a condition which will check what id was sent and possibly enter a specific state that in turn will play some animations depending on how it is set up. There is 3 action state machines, one that contains states for when the behavior is supposed to be a fullbody action, another one for fullbody but prone action and another one for any stance without being fullbody (additive actions, for example walking while eating). If there is no  condition for entering a state in whatever state machine you sent this ID to then it will default to a default state, which in turn plays that wrong animation you are experiencing.
The action manager will send the id to the corresponding state machine based on the method `IsFullBody` in your action which bases it's result by default on the `m_FullBody` variable and the `HasProneException` method in your action class , if the method `IsFullBody` returns `true` then it will send it to the `FullBodyActionMaster` or `FullBodyPneBActionMaster` if the player is also prone but on his back... if `false` then it will be sent to `ActionMaster`.

Saying all this, the solution for you issue is checking the name of the constant you want to feed it `CMD_ACTIONFB_DIG `
Notice the `FB`, this means it is set up in the animation graph as a condition for entering a state in `FullBodyActionMaster` so you should have this method in your action class
```csharp
override bool IsFullBody(PlayerBase player)
{
    return true;
}
```
or
```csharp
m_FullBody = true;
```
in the constructor of your action class",,
