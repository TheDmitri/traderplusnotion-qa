214427063665295362,aeryes,03/28/2020 3:47 AM,@Wardog  What is the best way to create web apps that provide functionality in a dayz server?,,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/28/2020 3:47 AM,Any ideas or advice?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2020 3:53 AM,"Polling technique, have dayz curl check a specific endpoint for commands to process on the game server every X seconds. Be careful with responses, they can't be too long as there's an apparent string limit to a curl response.",,
214427063665295362,aeryes,03/28/2020 3:53 AM,I have looked into that class file with curl before. Are there any tuts that you know of that show you examples of how it works?,,
561680015578759196,wrdg,03/28/2020 3:55 AM,"I don't have any tutorials, nor do I think the community examples repo does. At one point back when curl just came into the picture Thurston made somewhat a community example for curl. Might want to see if he could document it and publish it to the days community examples. I'm currently busy with a lot, so I can't sit down and write a decent example.",,

    void ~MyClassA() { Print(""~MyClassA()""); } // destructor

One method to have those cleaned up is using reference counting / the autoptr concept which will do that for you or using the baseclass Managed which also deals with that for you.,,

148370724900306944,jacob_mango,04/04/2020 1:55 PM,i've been told by someone (not bi) that it isn't a real thread,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,04/04/2020 1:56 PM,"but no, there is no limit in calling Sleep if you call it on another thread",,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,04/04/2020 1:57 PM,and it doesn't work if you call it on the main thread,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 1:58 PM,"In arma, code in another 'thread' can take up to 3ms of frame time. If it takes more to execute then scheduler suspends this 'thread' for this frame. It is same here I guess?",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 1:59 PM,Or does the other 'detached thread' run until I order it to suspend or yield?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/04/2020 2:00 PM,I’m pretty sure it’s multi threading based on how sone of my calls and ticks work out. But I could be bat shit wrong too. 🤷‍♂️,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,04/04/2020 2:00 PM,"Uh hmm, not familiar with arma so not sure if that is the same behaviour here or not",,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/04/2020 2:02 PM,SQf compiled linear I believe. So sleep would stop the whole thread.,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,04/04/2020 2:02 PM,It’s been so long since I even looked an sqf. Haha.,,
148370724900306944,jacob_mango,04/04/2020 2:02 PM,yeah sqf is an interpreted language whereas enforce is compiled,,

292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:03 PM,So the game compiles Enscript files straight to machine code?,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:04 PM,Or to some bytecode which is then being run by runtime? 🤔,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:11 PM,It's not real thread,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:12 PM,"If it was, you would have access to some sorts of mutex to be able to access to a resource not at the same time",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:12 PM,It's sounds like it just executed out of main thread,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:12 PM,Maybe before or after him,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:12 PM,yeah I guessed so,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:13 PM,But don't know if there is still a 3ms of frame time like Arma does,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:13 PM,I actually don't know how to test it,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:14 PM,Oh it's easy to test 😄,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:14 PM,while(true){};,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:14 PM,and see if it freezes the game,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:17 PM,"So in Arma, if you do that in a thread, it will not freeze your game lol",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:17 PM,Ok didn't knew that,,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:18 PM,"no, if a thread runs more than 3ms per frame, it is suspended and is put to the end of scheduker's queue",,
292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 2:18 PM,"if you do it in unscheduled(per frame handler, some other event handler), it freezes the game",,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:24 PM,So after my test,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:24 PM,the game freeze completly,,
235718406492520448,niirozz,04/04/2020 2:24 PM,there is not thing about 3ms or such,,

292735600837263360,Sparker#0791,04/04/2020 5:28 PM,"Another question: am I allowed to have a weak reference as a member variable of a class?
At wiki there is this example:
```
// classes and arrays
class ExampleClass
{
    //! weak reference to object
    MyClassA m_a;

    //! strong reference to object
    ref MyClassA m_b;

    //! strong reference to dynami array(dynamic array is object itself) of weak references
    ref array<MyClassA> m_c;

    //! strong reference to dynamic array of strong references
    ref array<ref MyClassA> m_d;

    //! static array of strong references
    ref MyClassA m_e[10];
};
```

Now, I can declare a weak ref in my class without issues:
```
class TestSquad
{
        ...
    TestSoldier m_basicPtrSoldier;
    ...
}
```

But trying to assign it results in an error at compilation time:
```
void TestSquad(string name)
    {
        m_name = name;
        m_basicPtrSoldier = new TestSoldier(""BasicPtr Soldier from Squad "" + name);
    }
```
Gives error:
`Variable 'm_basicPtrSoldier' is not strong ref (missing 'ref'?) !`

So I can only read a weak ref in a class, not write into it. Why does compiler let me declare it in first place then? And why do they show a weak ref in the wiki example?",,

I've found one more issue with Enforce script syntax page. I've tried to execute this code from here: <https://community.bistudio.com/wiki?title=DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax&oldid=148043#Managed_class_.26_pointer_safety>

// without Managed

void TestA()
{
    ClassA a1 = new ClassA();
    ClassA a2 = a1; // both a2 and a1 contain pointer to the same instance of A

    a1.Hello(); // prints ""hello""
    a2.Hello(); // prints ""hello""
    delete a1; // our instance of A is deleted and a1 is set to NULL

    if (a1) a1.Hello(); // nothing happens because a1 is NULL
    if (a2) a2.Hello(); // a2 is still pointing to deleted instance of A so condition pass. This line cause crash!

Then I call TestA(); function from `DayzGame::OnKeyPress(int key)` context.
I have a breakpoint at this line:
 `if (a2) a2.Hello(); // a2 is still pointing to deleted instance of A so condition pass. This line cause crash!`
