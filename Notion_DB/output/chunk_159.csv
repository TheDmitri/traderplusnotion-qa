Am I stupid or ref counter doesn't work properly? 
I know how garbage collector works, but it shouldn't destroy my object because I increment ref counter when value is returned",,

auto value = test_queue.PopFront();
```
Right before return of PopFront method I've printed it to logs and object still there, everything looks fine. The only reason that can explain this behavior that refcounter is decremented and after it's incremented. So it means that return doesn't work as it explained in BI documentation",,

Maybe it would be easier to explain what I have and what I need using this scenario:
1. Player throws an item by pressing G and holding LMB
2. In 100ms (or immediately) I need to create the same item in his inventory (on a server side)
3. If original item had a reserved slot before being thrown, the new one should have the same

I managed to do it using this callback: `override void OnInventoryExit(Man player)` of my item:
- used this function to determine throwing `playerBase.GetThrowing().IsThrowingAnimationPlaying()`
- in 100ms called a function to create the same item using the `CallQueue`
That works, but in this callback an item has no reserved slot...

234408947786711040,consequence.,08/07/2023 3:53 AM,yes because the script is printing out the debug,,
234408947786711040,consequence.,08/07/2023 3:54 AM,"that's why I put it there, to make sure the IF statement is only happening when it is supposed to",,

234408947786711040,consequence.,08/07/2023 3:55 AM,I just saw that,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,08/07/2023 3:55 AM,So it would run once but its a local variable so it wouldnt persist after closure,,

234408947786711040,consequence.,08/07/2023 3:56 AM,the explains it,,
234408947786711040,consequence.,08/07/2023 3:56 AM,I need it to persist after closure,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,08/07/2023 3:56 AM,Make it a class level variable and you will be golden ð,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,08/07/2023 3:57 AM,(Atleast what you showed above),,

87168005758283776,streatman,08/11/2023 4:28 PM,"hey, i need a little help. maybe i am blind but i am making a action that is supposed to let the player ""pack"" a kit back into a box.
but for some reason, the game doesnt give me the option...
the other actions that need tools and are on the tool work. and when i put that action on the screwdriver it also works. but players are supposed to be able to do that without anything in hand... ```c
class IZ_Furniture_Kit_Base : Container_Base
{
    override bool CanPutInCargo( EntityAI parent )
    {
        return false;
    }
    override bool CanPutIntoHands( EntityAI parent )
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();
        AddAction(ActionPackFurniture);
    }
};
