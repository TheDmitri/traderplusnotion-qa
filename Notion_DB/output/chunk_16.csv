like this. But in this example the M4 has a lower possibility than 60% because if the randomnumber is 1-20 Ak_Jungle would be choosen. So that does not work and if i have 2 sets with both 50% possibility that would also not work so any tips ?",,

120636711050018819,flyingmeat,12/15/2018 3:33 AM,but like I said I am just looking for what is possible to do.,,
90539677555101696,shix,12/15/2018 3:50 AM,why not use ```JsonSaveFile``` instead of writing to the script log ...,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 3:54 AM,"cuz why create a new file, us up more resources, for something that already has its own section?",,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 3:54 AM,if you debug normally you wont have problems seeing through your scripts.log,,
90539677555101696,shix,12/15/2018 3:55 AM,but its just plain messy,,
90539677555101696,shix,12/15/2018 3:55 AM,vs parsing a script log,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 3:59 AM,i don't get it why you think its messy,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 3:59 AM,my servers log if silled with lot of data,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 3:59 AM,and not messy at all,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 4:00 AM,and i dont think json is the correct even if you would want to log to a separate file,,
334756290742190081,._corey,12/15/2018 4:00 AM,rather use filehandle,,
90539677555101696,shix,12/15/2018 4:00 AM,you don't see how mixing data that he wants to pass to an API in to script log with everything else thats gonna log is messy ?,,
90539677555101696,shix,12/15/2018 4:01 AM,just my opinion though,,
138422791358775296,bigben.,12/15/2018 4:01 AM,Why did BI break new accounts on the wiki?   how is anyone supposed to help them fill it out?,,

120636711050018819,flyingmeat,12/15/2018 6:02 AM,did someone yet think of building a mod validator to ensure all clients are running the same mods ? (or atleast a version of the same mod) ?,,

120636711050018819,flyingmeat,12/15/2018 6:03 AM,but that is for the client right ? I am talking about server side validation,,

142181979905982464,dannydog,12/15/2018 6:06 AM,i mean i guess u could make a validator mod that sends over what mods the client has,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/15/2018 6:06 AM,just to tell the player they dont have the mods,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,12/15/2018 6:07 AM,but servers should be just using automated messages and a proper server name to state that its running mods,,
