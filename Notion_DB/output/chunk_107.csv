```
An expression that describes a function by specifying its parameters and the value that it returns. The term ‚Äúlambda‚Äù was coined by a logician named Alonzo Church in the 1930s. ... The Python programming language, for example, uses ‚Äúlambda‚Äù as a keyword for forming this type of anonymous function.

292234618667663361,kyhbka,12/10/2021 5:05 AM,"```
1) You just change the values of two variables without applying
  - SetAmbientColor(r, g, b);
  - SetDiffuseColor(r, g, b);
2) Case (i == 0 bla bla bla) will work only once because the variable i will never be equal to 0 after the function ChangeLightColor() is started

278046879265062912,the1corrupted,12/10/2021 5:49 AM,"Hey all, so in DayZ cooking, to determine what kind of cooking equipment the player is using, they have the following block defined in `4_world\classes\cooking.c`

```c
typename COOKING_EQUIPMENT_POT                         = Pot;
typename COOKING_EQUIPMENT_FRYINGPAN                = FryingPan;
typename COOKING_EQUIPMENT_CAULDRON                    = Cauldron;
typename COOKING_INGREDIENT_LARD                     = Lard;
```

Can I convert this into a more general-purpose data structure? I picked apart another mod where they used a `TStringArray` but does that function like a list of typenames? Or types?

If I use this, can I compare it directly to the type for exact class name? Or do I have to use `IsKindOf`?

```c
ref TStringArray CookingContainers = {""Pot"", ""FryingPan"", ""Cauldron""};

for (i=0; i<CookingContainers.Count; i++)
{
  if ( slot_item.Type() == CookingContainers[i] )
  {
      // We cooking with container
      break;
  }
  // Or like this?
  if ( slot_item.IsKindOf(CookingContainers[i] )
  {
    // Cooking with kind of container
    break;
  }
}
```
When I tried to add a tea pot to the game where you could set it on the stove, I found all kinds of stuff that I would need to touch as well to get it to boil, make the boiling sound and give off steam.

```
array<int> BitConvertInt(int agentBits)
{
    int cal = agentBits;
    array<int> byte = {128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1};
    array<int> output = {};

    for (int bit = 0; bit < byte.Count(); bit++)
    {
        if (cal >= byte[bit])
        {
            cal = cal - byte[bit];
            output.Insert(1);

        } else
        {
            output.Insert(0);                
        }
    }
    return output;
};
```

It'll return an array binary conversion of the integer so you can create a condition like this

```
array<int> BitInt = BitConvertInt(agents);
if (BitInt[0] == 1) //NERVE_AGENT Bit
{
    //Do stuff
}

```
Or as mario suggested, you can simply do this using the bitwise AND operator
```
if (agents&eAgents.CHOLERA)
{
     //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.INFLUENZA)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.SALMONELLA)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.BRAIN)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.FOOD_POISON)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.CHEMICAL_POISON)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.WOUND_AGENT)
{
    //Do stuff
}
if (agents&eAgents.NERVE_AGENT)
{
    //Do stuff
}
```

And it'll single out which agents are being ""digested"" with this method, hope that helps - any questions just shoot me a message",,

99298225999056896,cashewsan,12/15/2021 9:44 PM,"Running into an odd issue, might be a DayZ limitation or I'm missing something. I have this in my weapon's script:

```c
    override bool CanDisplayAttachmentSlot( string slot_name )
    {    
        if (!super.CanDisplayAttachmentSlot(slot_name))
            return false;   

        if ( slot_name == ""weaponOptics"" )
        {
            return this.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponOptics"") != NULL;
        }
        if ( slot_name == ""weaponOptics"" )
        {
            return this.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponRailAK"") == NULL;    
        }
        if ( slot_name == ""weaponOpticsAK"" )
        {
            return this.FindAttachmentBySlotName(""weaponOptics"") == NULL;
        }  

        return true;
    }
```
Basically, hiding the `weaponOptics` attachment slot unless the `weaponRailAk` slot is attached, and replacing it with `weaponOpticsAK` when not attached.

With screenshot 1, you're seeing the optic attached, but not showing in the attachment slot. Dropping the weapon and picking it back up fixes it (shown in screenshot 2). But when the rail and optic are removed and replaced with a optic from `weaponOpticsAK`, it updates the rail being removed, but does not update the original optic being removed (shown in screenshot 3). It's once again fixed by dropping it and picking it back up.

Essentially, looking for a fix to this without having to drop the weapon to update it. Or an answer to why it does it and if it's possible to fix or not","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/920778385188356106/Screenshot_86.jpg,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/920778385381265478/Screenshot_87.jpg,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492295576470290433/920778386253684746/Screenshot_88.jpg",

Would it be a sensible idea to write data that is related to the mission to mpmissions/<missionname>/storage_x instead of the usual place i.e. the server profile directory? Currently I'm writing a small binary file to the server profile folder (in a subdirectory) to store that data (essentially metadata) but it's a little awkward imo, because the data isn't at all profile related, it's mission-related, so I'm evaluating if I should move that file's location. I'm aware that I could use OnStoreLoad/Save to make that data part of the game's persistence files, but I don't necessarily want to do that because then adding/removing the mod breaks existing storage.",,
