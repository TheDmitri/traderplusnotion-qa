272245679013888011,marioe,02/01/2020 3:10 PM,Send a rpc that tells the client to send their lang to the server,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/01/2020 3:11 PM,Then do something with that,,
150883360019972096,hunterzcz,02/01/2020 3:11 PM,i would have descriptions of my items stored on server,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/01/2020 3:12 PM,Or make an int variable sync with the server on playerbase,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/01/2020 3:17 PM,If it was a state change ( where your descriptions were pre-written on client ) then @MarioE idea would work better and simple,,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,02/01/2020 3:20 PM,however you can choose to use CF ( community framework ) to somewhat simplify your RPC management ( its mostly a wrapper that helps make it less messy ),,

You can do this (Inside your item class)
```csharp
override void OnWorkStart()
    {
        super.OnWorkStart();
        PlayerBase player = PlayerBase.Cast(GetHierarchyParent());
        GetGame().ObjectDelete(this);
        GetGame().GetCallQueue(CALL_CATEGORY_SYSTEM).Call(callbackFunction, player);
    }
```
Outside your item class
```csharp
void callbackFunction(PlayerBase player)
    {
        if (player) {
            EntityAI itemEnt = player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInHands(""Roadflare"");
            if (itemEnt) {
                itemEnt.GetCompEM().SwitchOn();
                Print(""[AirdropFlare.OnWorkStart] Road Flare activted."");
            } else {
                Print(""[AirdropFlare.OnWorkStart] Couldn't get handle to Road Flare created in hand."");
            }
        } else {
            Print(""[AirdropFlare.OnWorkStart] Couldn't get handle to player activating AirdropFlare."");
        }

272245679013888011,marioe,02/02/2020 12:26 AM,This way you can do something after it was deleted,,
272245679013888011,marioe,02/02/2020 12:26 AM,Not just changing the item,,

I was looking through the script to see how it works, and there's options to create light sources that cast no shadows (much less lag for client), and handle all the shading/flickering/intensity values etc. 

I don't know of any good vanilla light sources you could spawn easily in init.c. You may want to look at creating your own light source via scripting/modding.

There are things like 'streetlights' you can place that produce light, might be your best option.

In one script I have this, we will call it config.c and it‚Äôs included in the init.c

``` modded class CustomMission: MissionServer

Protected bool TestoverRide1 = true 
Protected bool TestoverRide2 = true

``` modded class CustomMission: MissionServer

If (!testoverride1) 
{ 
Some random code test1

If (!testoverride2) 
{
diff random code test2
