1) The mod is great for PvE. Thanks.

2) I think that if you were to add the same changes to wolves and make an all-in-one mod with a clearer title, e.g., ""Aggressive Bears and Wolves,"" it would really take off in popularity.

I tried looking at the scripting that you did, but I have not the foggiest idea how to implement the same changes to wolves. My idea was that I would simply send the information to you so that you could add it, but that required me understanding what you did!

208561436450881536,dountill,01/21/2022 9:38 PM,"Allow me to be more clear on my question.

I am trying to make an object placeable in DayZ. Can someone guide me on how to approach this? I've added the following:

```C
    class Inventory_Base;

    // Custom placeable signs
    class SGPlaceableWoodSignBase : Inventory_Base
    {
        scope=2;
        displayName=""Placeable Sign"";
        descriptionShort=""Place this sign by yourself."";
        model=""EVO\@EvocatusSigns\woodsign3.p3d"";
        bounding=""BSphere"";
        overrideDrawArea=""3.0"";
        handheld=""true"";
        carveNavmesh=1;
        canBeDigged=0;
        weight=1200;
        itemSize[]={3,2};
        rotationFlags=16;
        isMeleeWeapon=0;
        lootCategory=""Materials"";
        reversed=0;
        absorbency=0;
        itemBehaviour=2;
    };
```

The above is the part to init my class. After that I created an object based on this:

```C
    class SG_Billboard_Aircraft_Trader_Placeable_S : SGPlaceableWoodSignBase
    {
        scope = 2;
        displayName = ""Aircraft Trader Sign (Placeable)"";
        descriptionShort = ""A custom placeable sign"";
        hiddenSelectionsTextures[] = { ""ModPack\Collection\Billboards\Images\billboard_aircraft_trader.paa"" };
    };
```

As the last part. In my `SGPlaceableWoodSignBase.c` file I have the following (which seems to work, when I remove the `ActionTakeItemToHand` item, the item responds to this.

```C
class SGPlaceableWoodSignBase extends ItemBase
{
    void SGPlaceableWoodSignBase()
    {

    }


    override bool CanPutIntoHands(EntityAI parent) 
    {
         return true;
    }
    
    override bool IsDeployable()
    {
        return true;
    }

    override void SetActions()
    {
        super.SetActions();
        AddAction(ActionTogglePlaceObject);
        AddAction(ActionPlaceObject);
        // AddAction(ActionDeployObject);
        AddAction(ActionTakeItemToHands);
    }
}
```

Unfortunately I am not able to place the object down. Could it be that the object (p3d) itself is not prepared for it?",,

1. theres a check that i can do that sees if its trying to put items inside one of my cases and if it does then it puts it into Temporarystoragecontainers acting as if my inventory is full
