I have a action derived from ActionInteractBase, and it has overwritten OnStartClient. The action is assigned to a scripted building derived from BuildingSuper. It works properly when a specific mod isn't present, but the function OnStartClient is not called at all when the other mod is present. The ActionCondition remains functional, though. I get the ""hint"" to start the action, but when I click F the hint only disappears for a split second and does nothing. I also tried using OnExecuteClient and it didn't work. I decompiled the other mod to inspect it and there was nothing (that I see) that could have caused this (it's just another mod with another action derived from ActionInteractBase).
