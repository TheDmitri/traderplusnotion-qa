328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 10:59 AM,hi guys i found a strange fact...√π,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:05 AM,"if i get the players on server with:

```c
ref array<Man> players = new array<Man>;
GetGame().GetPlayers( players );```

if i put a check like

```c
if(!players) return;```
the function go on without problem without any player on the server.

the fact that `players` is declared and initialized is a thing?",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 11:08 AM,Sure it does and that's correct. Having a valid pointer to a array that can store references to man entities is something completely different than there actually being any references stored in it,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 11:09 AM,You are checking if the pointer stored behind the players array is not null. Not if it is empty,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:09 AM,yeah true!,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:09 AM,so i should do something like,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:09 AM,players.Count == 0,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 11:10 AM,It you want to check if it is empty yes,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:11 AM,"yeah ^^ im having a problem, im sending an RPC in `missionServer` to `player `/ `player.GetIdentity()`  and dunno why ( it's the only case in which happens this.. ) the RPC received on Client strats a sound but it tells me that the sounds is generated ServerSide and it lags a bit when happen",,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:12 AM,but just the facts that the RPCS is received is mandatory to have a player existing in the server,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 11:20 AM,thanks for the clarification above üòÑ,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 12:58 PM,"@affenb3rt

You could just do this though right?..
```
ref array<Man> players = new array<Man>;
PlayerBase player = PlayerBase.Cast(players[0]);
if (!player) return;
```


Reference:
Missionserver 
```c
for (int i = 0; i < m_Players.Count(); i++) {
      PlayerBase player = PlayerBase.Cast(m_Players[i]);
      if (!player || !player.IsAlive() || !player.GetIdentity()) continue;
//Set variable to true
}
```",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:00 PM,No because if there is no  element in the array you will have a out of bounds access,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 1:01 PM,So you'd still need the if (players) check?,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 1:02 PM,Or is that just checking if the array exists at all regardless of elements?,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 1:04 PM,"Or could you just cheese it with...

   ref array<Man> players = new array<Man>;

if (!player) return;

328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 1:13 PM,yeah was just an idea i had to finda solution on why it pop up the error that the sound is generated via Server which instead is generated on a RPC to client,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 1:14 PM,now im shifting 3/4 of the code directly in PlayerBase keeping in Mission Server only what i need,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:15 PM,This is just checking the variable has a valid value (a pointer to an array) assigned to it. If you want to check if the array is empty you check for count being 0,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:15 PM,Anything else is wrong,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 1:15 PM,i thought that maybe when event starts there is no player and send the rpc to dunno where ahah but it has no sense cuz the RPC which involve the sound have player as obj and player IDentity so if there is 0 it does not even start ^^,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 1:15 PM,pointer stuff is something i wanna learn too :p,,
328461966232256513,varyel,02/06/2023 1:16 PM,but this is really code language related,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:17 PM,GetRandomElement prolly returns null for an array with no values that are no primitive types. So yes it might work but is still missusing something that's not meant to be used this way,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:18 PM,You simply check of the pointer to the array is valid and if that's the case if the count is 0,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 1:18 PM,"So you'd say..
```
   ref array<Man> players = new array<Man>;
GetGame().GetPlayers(players);
if (players.Count() == 0) return;
```",,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:19 PM,Count is a method not a property,,
743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/06/2023 1:19 PM,Also you have a ref on a local variable,,
295995523658285066,truedolphin,02/06/2023 1:20 PM,I'd be putting that in a class..,,

94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/06/2023 5:04 PM,You can technically add any attachment to any item via `inventorySlot[]`(which slots an item can attach to) and `attachments[]`(what items are expected to be attached) config properties. You can find existing attachments in the CfGSlots definitions scattered around the codebase.,,
94225995581620224,itsatreee,02/06/2023 5:04 PM,You can define your own attachments inside CfgSlots as well.,,

Currently, this is all I am overriding for the 3 scripts I've made. the `raidEnabled()` function is in the bottom of each one script (I've excluded it here. It works as intended down to the minute, simply returns true if within allowed raid times/days)

1. All 3 scripts disable raiding and display the custom message properly unless `raidEnabled()` returns true. While raiding is disabled, you cannot use the tools (as intended)
2. MSP override - After the saw action finishes the lock does not take any damage.
3. BreachingCharge overide - No issue
4. BBP override - After the raid hammer action finishes the door does not delete.

Hoping someone can point me in the right direction

The Loot is there, if unlocked and opened it's shown correctly. But you cant take it, it wont be released. CallLater or a timer wont work nor spawn any loot at all.
CJ Lootchest guy had the same problem i guess lol, the comments include ways i tried too. It looks like he solved it with an own class for his Chests and is spawning the crates with loot/weapons via this class, send by RPC's to sync correctly.

Now, __if I can't mod Class B__, is there a way to have the same event handling without having to repeat the exact same code in all subclasses? Note, __the event method is NOT defined in the superclass Class A__. 

So far, what I did as a solution for this problem is using association instead of inheritance: I coded the event handling into a separated object and called it from all Class B subclasses  (X, Y and Z). That way I don't have the bulk of the logic repeated, but I still have to repeatedly override the event method in each subclass of Class B and call the handling code defined in the aforementioned object.

I have a small problem that I could not solve until now.
I have built an own item with several slots. Woodenplank, WoodenLog, Nail and th_metal_parts.
I have also create th_metal_parts as a new item. It is stackable to 10 pieces.

Now I have written a recipe that queries the various items in the slots according to quantity.
This works with all items like woodenplanks, nails and woodenlog. But not with my own th_metal_parts.

When starting the server, I always get the error message from the recipe that the variable th_metal_part can't be found.

Does anyone have an idea how to define this variable in config.cpp or what is needed in config?",,

743565979258454101,affenb3rt,02/16/2023 8:43 AM,Since command handler is run on both serves and client for the controlling player it has to be executed on both or you will get desync,,
