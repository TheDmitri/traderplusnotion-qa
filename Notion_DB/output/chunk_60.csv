105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:14 AM,@DaemonForge are you aware that super.Init() will call OnPlayerloaded ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:15 AM,\*maybe\* you have to register your netsyncs before calling super.Init() ?,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/11/2020 2:16 AM,"Ill try that, (think i might have already tried that but will try again cause you know, dayz üôÇ )",,
267120764283518976,xedon,07/11/2020 2:20 AM,@TheDimin sorry I'm very new to scripting with enfusion. How can I add the current environment & body temperature to the hud? Do you have maybe an example how to add that values? I would be very happy about a little help,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:21 AM,"Hey, Im not confident enough in those departments to help you more with it sorry",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:25 AM,"If you look at the Temperature widget , trace it back you can find the info about it",,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:28 AM,@DaemonForge ?,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/11/2020 2:28 AM,"Updated my previous message, to what it look like now, but it still not syncing",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:29 AM,@Xedon if you are using vscode you can ctrl + shift + f and search Temperature/heat and get all references,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:30 AM,But in this case its part of the IngameHud.c,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:33 AM,"@DaemonForge can you confirm the value does get changed on the server ?
It could be (A GUESS) that it cannot be replicated in OnPlayerLoaded yet
Looking at what BI did they set the value before registering the netsync, Maybe thats manditory ?",,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/11/2020 2:34 AM,"Yeah the `habPrint` is just a fancy print lol, and it does print on the server",,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:36 AM,could you try to change the value in a function that is called later ?,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:38 AM,Im not sure what the issue is so im thinking about a weird race where the value is set before the client actualy recieves values,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:38 AM,But,,

105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:40 AM,could be possible to move the whole if statement + scope BEFORE the register net syncs,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:40 AM,then you props don't have have to mark the sync dirty either,,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 2:40 AM,*maybe* you do have to call super first,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/11/2020 2:41 AM,Ill try that and see what happens lol,,
202828762310508554,daemonforge,07/11/2020 2:52 AM,"Well I figured out why I did it in player loaded lol the identity isn't set yet, up so moved it all to OnPlayerLoaded to see if that works",,
105031327861977088,thedimin,07/11/2020 3:08 AM,Maybe it could work in OnSelectPlayer,,

181254147679584257,thesixx,07/11/2020 3:37 AM,I think that my LoadConfig file can't be read in a different module so I need to create a different one to the other module. Like one to 4_world and other to 3_game,,

```c
class StashZone extends ManTrigger
{
    private ref SurvivorStash m_stash;
    
    override void EOnInit(IEntity other, int extra)
    {
        const vector mins = ""-200 -200 -200"";
        const vector maxs = ""200 200 200"";
        SetExtents(mins, maxs);
        
        Print(""[StashZone] created @ "" + GetPosition());
    }
    
    override void OnEnter( Object o )
    {
        if (GetGame().IsServer() && m_stash)

    void SetStash(SurvivorStash stash)
    {
        m_stash = stash;
