A few days ago i was trying to create an addition to my dm mod that lets players keep their loot so they spawn with the same stuff they died with.
I looked around a little and found MiscGameplayFunctions.TransferItemProperties and MiscGameplayFunctions.TransferInventory
Now what i do is i remove all the items from the player on death and when they spawn i create a new item from the same type and call these methods on them. The player spawns with the same items but the items in the inventory dont show up (ammo, mags + meds) until the player relogs. How can i sync it so the player can see the transfered items in his clothing?",,

I have a problem with action OnFinishServer() method.

I make a self test and the main item is deletted, but I can't create another item in my hands.

```cpp
override void OnFinishProgressServer(ActionData action_data)
{
    action_data.m_MainItem.Delete();
    ItemBase testResItem = action_data.m_Player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInHands(""z_TestResult"");
    PlayerBase player = PlayerBase.Cast(action_data.m_Player);
    player.GetSoftSkillsManager().AddSpecialty(m_SpecialtyWeight);
}
```

My another script is working.
```cpp
override void OnFinishProgressServer( ActionData action_data )
{
    TStringArray moneys = {""alp_Money10"",""alp_Money20"",""alp_Money100"",""alp_Money500"",""alp_Money1000""};
    string money = moneys.GetRandomElement();
    int darabszam = Math.RandomInt(1,5);
    ItemBase foundedMoney = action_data.m_Player.GetHumanInventory().CreateInHands(money);
    foundedMoney.SetQuantity(darabszam);
}

For some reason my shovel, pickaxe, & hoe are not making the farming plots. I have tried with or without a flag and land claim from BBP. So my question is this.

What would make these tools not work and do the plots?

202143862200860672,aherys_,01/31/2022 7:57 PM,"Hello guys, little ""tutorial"" or ""code snippet"" cause i was struggeling on something, and i share in case someone in the future struggle on the same.

**The issue :** Adding a new ""PlayerStat"" to the game, but keeping compability with others mods who add also stat.
Normally, you should just set the enum to avoid any conflict :
```cpp
enum EPlayerStatsExtended_current : EPlayerStats_current
{
    DRUG = 821344,
};```

But unfortunally, GetPlayerStats function for some reason Dayz Dev didn't look for the ID of the stat, BUT for the place in the collection.
```cpp
GetPlayerStats().GetStatObject(EPlayerStats_current.DRUG);
```

So the fix a bit dirty, is to modify your GetStatsYOURSTAT function like this (Here, a stat drug i implemented)
```cpp
PlayerStat<float> GetStatDrug()
    {
        if( !m_StatDrug && GetPlayerStats() )
        {    
            // Look to every possible Stat we have, and stop when we got the correct one. Dirty, but it work.
            // If you found a more elegant/optimised way, notice me.    
            for(int i = 0; i < 2147483646; i++)
            {
                m_StatDrug = PlayerStat<float>.Cast(GetPlayerStats().GetStatObject(i));
                if (m_StatDrug && m_StatDrug.GetLabel())
                {
                    // Compare with Label, so instead of Drug, place your stat label
                    if (m_StatDrug.GetLabel() == ""Drug"")
                    {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                m_StatDrug = null;
            }
        }
        return m_StatDrug;
    }```",,

202143862200860672,aherys_,01/31/2022 9:17 PM,"It's correct.

To be more deep : NULL basically mean 0.
In C/CPP you work with pointer (here they are called reference, it's not the same thing... but... well, let's keep thing simple).

In reality, a pointer store the memory address of another variable, and allow to go on it.
We set a a value on NULL when it's not initialised OR free (A variable we don't use, and deallocate in memory). The reason behind is if we keep the old variable address, then we don't fucking know if she still under the memory allocated by our programm or not (and if she is not, we gonna segfault, who lead most of the time to a programe crash), it's why we put set the pointer adresse to 0 or NULL (same thing).

Fortunally, C# make thing easier, and take care for you for most of the thing.
But NULL stay something, basically if you have a Null pointer to instance is the item doesn't exist when the variable try to access to it.

So in our case : the class ContinuousInteractActionInput doesn't exist when UpdatePossibleActions try to read it.
Either you didn't pass the correct reference/variable, either you erase it, and in the end, doing a bad init.",,
