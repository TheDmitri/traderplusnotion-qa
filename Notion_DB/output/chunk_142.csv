Probably cuz of the has. The keys ranged from 1.15 to 0.00001 so for my application it works great.",,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/26/2023 7:27 AM,reason id like to have the server cerate the map is so when a player interacts with it.. it can be removed from the map.. so another played cant interact with it.. since its not in the map anymore.. these examples are ALL script.. no config class needed to get the data.. essentially bypassing the invisible proxy bug when defining static objects in config that are used as proxies inside buildings..,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/26/2023 7:31 AM,"the player can remove the kep no issue.. the problem is, since the map is built at house base lvl... each player builds a map when they enter the bubble.. though i havent tested if its the same map if one player enters first.. then a second player enters..",,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,01/26/2023 7:31 AM,The map is stored on server?,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/26/2023 7:32 AM,well thats where my IsServer queries came from.. if the server builds the map.. player doesnt have access to it.. that ive found.. cuz parent object IDs are diff for player verses server..,,
239201186933112833,da0ne_,01/26/2023 7:33 AM,"That's not the only reason, the map would not be synced regardless because the code is being ran on server",,

239201186933112833,da0ne_,01/26/2023 7:33 AM,So your goal is to sync the actions between all players. Then you need to base your `ActionCondition` on a map that is only build once on server,,
665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/26/2023 7:34 AM,im not REAL worried about it.. cuz i have a work around in the action to prevent another player from targeting the same 'proxy' location..,,

665471546525220875,Zedmag#7576,01/27/2023 5:59 PM,Sounds like a donator kit. Seeing as players that are already existing in world should be getting new items. Only players that fresh spawns should be getting gear. therefor you would be a strip trip them first and spawn the desired gear on them directly with plenty of room. Can even spawn a barrel or create in their had and fill it with gear. But you shouldn‚Äôt be giving players gear after they‚Äôve already been created and been playing.,,
206065949793714187,henklr,01/27/2023 6:05 PM,"Donator kits wouldn't be allowed by bi i think üòÆ 
Yeah, so it's a bit different because what i do is, i want to transfer a player to a new server. Which mean saving their inv to a file, connecting them to server, and spawning the same gear once connected as well as teleporting them to a set location.",,
206065949793714187,henklr,01/27/2023 6:08 PM,So i strip the guy and spawn the stuff when he connects. This works fine as long as there is a CallLater after SetPosition. Or if i spawn inv before setting pos. But then we have the items on ground problem,,

SOOOOO i have rpcs in OnStart and OnEndClient.. that turn around and call the OnStart and OnEndServer for me.. HOWEVER.. when creating a new Action that inherites from the BASE action.. I cant have modders mucking up the RPC. and the new childs. OnEndServers dont get called.. only the parents.. it stops at the parent you see.. since the RPC is casting to the parent.. now i can do all of this manuly.. BUT this is to make it so modders dont have to mod the base class or and rpc.... does that all make sense?,,

1. You want to have the client send an RPC to the server in the base class.  
2. But you __do not want__ any subsequent modder to be able to change that i.e. sealed (I think that it can still be modded though). 
3. This is where I'm unclear...do you want the base class to be able to make something happen in the extended ""child"" class? But the base class necessarily doesn't know anything about the child Do I have that right?",,

You'd find that out by searching up the definition of jModifiers using notepad++ or my favorite dngrep.  The definition is probably in the tourniquet.c file but could also be else where.,,
