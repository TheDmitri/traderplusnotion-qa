this

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 1:25 PM,oh upon closer inspection I realize it's a mask,,
402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 2:34 PM,"another question. i managed to code a dynamite stick taht you need to ignite with fire before throwing  for it to explode. problem is the action to ignite takes a stupid long time to perform. can you change the ""craft"" time script side?",,
107560637399306240,cooltrain,07/03/2019 3:04 PM,As in the action you made to light it? If so yes,,
402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 3:12 PM,im using the vanilla ActionLightItemOnFire,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:26 PM,"```c

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:26 PM,"okay, so let's break down this a little for you",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:27 PM,`UATimeSpent.FIREPLACE_IGNITE` is the time it takes to perform the action,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:28 PM,"you can either setup a class with constants inside it like Bohemia have with UATimeSpent, or you can set another variable in it's place, or even hard code the value into `CAContinuousTime(  )`",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:28 PM,"I only dealt with the relevant part to what you were doing of ActionlightItemOnFire, the callback",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:33 PM,so in this case you'd probably want to make a clone of the action,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:33 PM,and use your custom action,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:34 PM,that way you don't have to edit vanilla timer,,
402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 3:34 PM,"yeah thats what i figured i would do too, thanks man.",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:34 PM,"there is also a bool that you can set in actions, that make them instant",,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:39 PM,"what it brought to mind to me, was maybe the ability to show the action once you have the item already ""wound up"" for throwing",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:39 PM,"ie, wind up your throw, THEN remove the pin",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:40 PM,or in the case of dynamite light the fuse,,

402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 3:42 PM,so should i make a new recipe that has the craft time as instant?,,

368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:42 PM,there is an IsInstant method in actions you can override with returning true,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:42 PM,which triggers it immediately,,

put that inside your custom action",,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:43 PM,that will trigger the animation and callback immediately,,
368717325484032001,aussiecleetus,07/03/2019 3:44 PM,actions are still a little mystical but I think I'm starting to understand the way they are now,,
402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 3:47 PM,"so could i maybe do a modded class ActionLightItemOnFire, ```override bool IsInstant()

return false;

402077901174079499,munghard,07/03/2019 3:48 PM,feeling reluctant to make a custom action tbh,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,07/04/2019 5:44 AM,My best recommendation to you before anything further is to use dayz tools to make p drive and then extract game data,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,07/04/2019 5:44 AM,Then you can use game files as samples,,

207328818203983872,notabanana,07/04/2019 5:45 AM,And use find in files against .cpp (config) and .c (script) files for examples for things,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,07/04/2019 5:45 AM,Changing cargo is similar to what @Wardog posted but grabbing the items you want instead of ammo and only including the cargo size config entry,,
207328818203983872,notabanana,07/04/2019 5:46 AM,"But make sure you have the addon (At the top of the config.cpp, the class in cfgpatches is the addon name) the item is originally from in your required addons in your cfgpatches",,
