334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:06 PM,"yeah, the thing we would have to disable"""" is the one that receives the message on server side, then forwards it into output",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:07 PM,Which is implemented in native code as I understand,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/09/2018 11:07 PM,Probably uses some of the same APIs as the VoIP system since it's area local?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/09/2018 11:10 PM,yeah maybe,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:06 AM,yeah i would not make a chat based admin system honestly,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:07 AM,its okay in other games but in DayZ i rather stick to UI,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:18 AM,does someone know how to make a character completely static?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:18 AM,"for example a zombie, that stays in place, doesn't react to punches, shots or anything",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 12:19 AM,spawn it with ai = false?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:19 AM,what do you mean by that?,,

120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 12:20 AM,4th param,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:30 AM,"i think basically, every unprovided parameter is false as default",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:30 AM,"so i think it won't make a difference to test it with false, i'll see",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 12:32 AM,"physics is true by default, but yes",,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 12:32 AM,"If you weren't providing it, then no reason to.",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:33 AM,"yeah, it would be good to spawn for example a survivor, or a playerbase without any physics on them",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:33 AM,for traders example,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:33 AM,"you make a new class, add the interactions to it",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:34 AM,so it opens the trader menu  when you walk up to the guy (or woman)  and press F,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 12:34 AM,"already got that part working , but the character can be killed, or pushed around by heavy punching",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 12:59 AM,You can 100% suppress chat messages from being sent to the server with a client mod btw @Corey,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 12:59 AM,ChatInputMenu is a PITA to mod though for various reasons,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:00 AM,"Easier to create your own ChatInputMenu, then override MissionBase:",,

120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 1:02 AM,The problem we're trying to combat is the server sending messages to clients,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 1:03 AM,The server needs to receive the message to propagate it to the event listener,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:03 AM,Well there was talking about suppressing it using a client mod,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:03 AM,"Whereas you could just stop it from sending from the client, do your command processing there, then send an RPC to the server",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:04 AM,"So rather than the server processing chat, you're sending it proper commands instead",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:04 AM,That also means players wouldn't have to use #login for their chat to be picked up by the server,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:05 AM,They'd have to have the mod installed of course,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:05 AM,@hairywookiee yeah i did that before,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:05 AM,but still not the best option,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:05 AM,it would be better if you could do it with a serverside script without modding,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:05 AM,"cuz if you suppress your message like that, it still appears on the server for other players",,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:06 AM,What do you mean? the message doesn't get sent to the server at all if you do what I did above ^ therefore other players can't ever get it,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:07 AM,ah wait yeah its a custom chat,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:07 AM,Yup,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:07 AM,You can't mod the existing one easily because it has private variables 😦,,
261535471698575370,hairywookiee,11/10/2018 1:08 AM,Of course at this point you might as well make a complete AdminUI if you're already doing client mods 😛,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,Trying to get into the ui workbench.. doesn't seem that intuitive,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,what do you mean?,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,the UI editor?,,
120714283246944256,thepsilonnaught,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,Yeah,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,its pretty good,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,but i think i am so far used to creating them manually i would keep doing that instead,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:10 AM,would be good if you could change the background,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:11 AM,but i just create an image and stretch it out,,

334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:13 AM,not something you add to the game,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:13 AM,just while you are working,,
142181979905982464,dannydog,11/10/2018 1:13 AM,yes so u use it as a template,,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:13 AM,"so you have  an ingame screenshot as ""canvas""",,
334756290742190081,._corey,11/10/2018 1:21 AM,wish there would be a lock option as well,,
